"1","WORST AIRLINE","I travel a lot - and I travel often. Last week I flew from Texas USA to Paris to Algiers - and then back the same way for the return flight. First before my trip I purchased luggage checked luggage and then after 2 weeks I saw that it wasn't showing on my ticket. So I call customer service and they said yeah we don't see it here. I told them okay. I have the confirmation from PayPal and also I have confirmation on my bank statement that they took out the full payment for the luggage and still they wouldn't fix the issue. Finally 3 days before my flight I had to call again and they finally put it on my ticket that I had paid for it. Then at the airport they give me many additional security screenings and at the Paris airport they weigh your carry-on bags that includes the backpack I had and my small carry-on luggage which has to be under 12 kg. Mine was 14 so I either had to pay $400 to check the bag. The small carry-on luggage bag or throw away all my clothes so I ended up having to throw away all my clothes because I don't have an extra $400 laying around to spare for a small luggage. No other airline or airport has this type of insanity where they weigh your carry-on bags, including your purse or your backpack and your personal item on the plane. Only Air France does this and only the Paris airport. Does this no other airline ways even your personal items and then tries to charge you $400 to check it. Also the Air front staff is always rude except for the staff on the plane like the flight attendants. But the in airport staffs and any airport are always very rude and they don't like to help be helpful or give information. All the Air France flights leak condensation from the top. This happened on all Air France planes to and from my destination. Go look at the reviews for Air France and you will see that everyone that's posted in the past years had a terrible experience with Air France, planes, travel and employees and customer service. I will never fly Air Force again and many people come to me for travel advice because I travel very often and I will always tell people never to fly Air France.","2024-11-13"
"1","Terrible experience with Airfrance","This review is regarding flight AF185, we booked an Economy Flex flight just so we can choose our own seats in the flight, but even though we’re SkyPriority, we stayed inline for around 2 hours with overly vague information regarding that delay only for them in the end to get back to us and say that our seats were relocated to worse ones.

The halal meal that was given to us was extremely bland, and we weren’t even offered any juice/soft drink to accompany the meal compared to others that didn’t specify they wanted a halal meal.

The staff were also overly rude to both me and my daughter compared to other passengers for some reason (could be because we were wearing a hijab) which was completely unbearable.

Overall, my experience with Airfrance was definitely an unforgettable one but in a negative sense unfortunately and I’d never board any plane with their logo in my life again","2024-11-13"
"1","Extremely Disappointing Experience with Air France (Flight #AF185, HKG to CDG)","I recently flew with Air France on flight #185 from Hong Kong to Paris (Nov 10th, 2024), and I am deeply disappointed with the service provided. My experience was marked by a series of issues that left me feeling frustrated and disrespected.

Sky Priority Service at Hong Kong Airport
Despite paying for Sky Priority, the staff at Hong Kong airport made us wait for an unreasonable amount of time without any clear explanation. This was especially frustrating as we had expected expedited service.
Last-Minute Seat Change
In addition to the delays, my seat was changed at the last minute, and it was given to another passenger. This lack of communication and poor handling of seating arrangements added unnecessary stress to the journey.
Discriminatory Treatment on the Plane
During the flight, my group and I experienced what felt like discriminatory treatment, simply because we are Muslims. We were made to feel uncomfortable and unwelcome, which is completely unacceptable.
Halal Meal Quality
Lastly, the halal meal provided was subpar. It was nowhere near the quality of the meals given to other passengers. The meal was not only poorly prepared but also felt like an afterthought. As a paying customer, I expected the same level of attention and care as others on board.
This experience with Air France was incredibly disappointing, and I expect better service from such a reputable airline. I hope this feedback is taken seriously so that other passengers do not have to endure the same treatment. I will certainly be reconsidering my choice of airline for future flights.","2024-11-12"
"1","Horrible","Wow!!! What a horrible experience!! I've always flown with Porter and was shocked at how bad Air France is in comparison.

First they have you check in by printing your own boarding pass on a computer, when porter sends you a digital copy. The problem is the computer doesn't even work, so you have to see an attendant (who is busy and irritable).

Then if flying economy, you're squished in a row of 3 to 4 people, the seats are tight and it was the most uncomfortable flight ever.

After eating the tasteless food, my stomach hurt for hours. I was in agonizing pain. When I went to the bathroom one of the flight attendants banged on my door telling me there's turbulence and I need to go back to my seat. So would you rather I throw up all over my seat?? 

I mentioned multiple times to multiple attendants I wasn't feeling good, no one did anything to help.

I asked for a second chamomile tea the second time they came around. The male flight attendant said only have black tea. Since I needed chamomile to sooth my stomach, I gave him my empty cup with the tea bag and asked him for hot water. He yelled out, OMG!! and stormed off. Wtf?? Your job is literally to bring that out and you have the nerve to yell out?? 

I will Never fly with Air France again. Bad food. Bad service. Extremely uncomfortable. Also, everything is in FRENCH and they don't even bother to translate to ENGLISH!! Even though I took the flight from Toronto and 90% of the passengers were east Asian.","2024-11-11"
"1","The Worst Flight Experience I’ve Ever Had","I spent a fantastic 10-day vacation in Hong Kong with my family, but our return flight with Air France (Flight AF 185) ruined the experience. When we arrived at the check-in counter, we waited over two hours just to receive our boarding passes. Then, only an hour before the flight, they informed us that our pre-selected seats had been changed due to a ""problem."" They assured us the new seats would have extra legroom, though two out of five seats would lack screens. Since we had no other flight options, we reluctantly accepted.

Once we boarded, we discovered our original seats, which had a “problem,” were sold to other passengers—even though we booked the flight three months ago. The new seats were far from an upgrade. Two of them were actually intended for staff, with no screens, no USB ports, and awkwardly positioned in the middle of the aisle—not ideal for a 13-hour flight. Because of this awkward placement, passengers frequently stepped on my foot whenever they passed by to use the restroom. To make matters worse, a sick passenger sat next to me, and I ended up getting sick as well.

When I raised these issues with a flight attendant, I mentioned that I had paid for Sky Priority to select my seat because this was a long flight and I have sleeping problems. She dismissed my concerns, saying, “You will get refund,” and walked away while I was still speaking. The same attendant later bumped into my knee with her drink cart multiple times and even stepped on my foot without apologizing. The food was also terrible; hardly anyone around me finished half of it.

Overall, it was literally the worst flight experience I’ve ever had, and I wouldn’t recommend Air France. The lack of professionalism, poor seating arrangement, and dismissive treatment from the staff left us deeply disappointed.","2024-11-11"
"3","Really cheap flight experience","We travelled with Air France to New Delhi from Paris, both ways and i was really dissappinted with their economy services. Really bad food, uncortable seats. I felt like i was flying with a low cost company.
I don’t know if this is the case with all destinations.
Everything looked really cheap.
On our flight back, we didn’t even received water, the personel was unpolite and rude with the indian clients…
Comparing with companies, Air France was the worst experience so far.","2024-11-10"
"2","Be Mindful of your Carry-On baggage Weight and Size!","Your carry-on luggage/personal item total weight must be less than 26.4lbs. They do weigh your carry on prior to security. They are also strict with the size of your carry-on bag and will make you check your carry-on if it is too large. Don't make the same mistake we did and have to pay 140 euros at the airport because our carry-on was too large.","2024-11-10"
"1","Terrible Customer Service and Duplicate Baggage Charges – Avoid Air France!","I recently had a highly disappointing experience with Air France that I feel compelled to share. I booked an international trip through a third-party site, but my e-ticket and booking reference were issued by Air France. My itinerary included three legs:

Kunming to Shanghai (operated by China Eastern Airlines, AF5227/MU9727)
Shanghai to Paris (Air France, AF111)
Paris to New York (Air France, AF111)
Despite being on a single ticket, I was charged twice for the same two pieces of checked baggage—$270 for the first leg and $240 for the second/third legs. I understand my ticket had zero baggage allowance, but I shouldn't have to pay twice for the same baggage on an international itinerary.

I contacted Air France multiple times for a refund, but their customer service was unhelpful, insisting I contact China Eastern Airlines for the first leg, even though Air France was the ticketing carrier. This is unacceptable. Air France should take responsibility and resolve issues involving their partner airlines, not pass the burden onto their customers.

I also filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation, but to date, I’ve received no resolution from either party. This experience has left me frustrated and significantly out of pocket.

If you value clear policies and responsive customer service, I strongly recommend avoiding Air France. Their lack of accountability has been a nightmare to deal with, and I won’t be booking with them again.","2024-11-08"
"2","Nightmare","I researched for weeks and felt like I had found a good carrier with Premium Economy. Went ahead and booked probably 8 months before departure. Long story short, about one month before our departure AF moved us around which lost all our extras I had booked. Anyway, there were several things that happened that made the experience with AF miserable. I will never use them again and would never recommend them.","2024-11-07"
"1","Not the Air France I remember from previous years","The food gets worse every year and so does the service. No one came to collect garbage, so passengers started leaving it in a pile. The attendant saw it and left the pile for most of the flight.","2024-11-07"
"5","Pleasantly supervised.....","Being a Air France (hop) flight, we did not expect much, however when we checked in, the staff member moved us from row 2 to row 1 which gave significantly more leg room, the attendant was friendly, the food was well presented, however, not really our thing, the lounge breakfast was far superior and we had our fill, champagne was cracked to go with the salmon, which we enjoyed.
We were very lucky to have a superb pilot. There were extreme cross winds on approach to Dublin, he took us down smoothly, many flights were cancelled or diverted as the day went on.
We will definitely fly with these guys again.","2024-11-07"
"1","Avoid AirFrance at all costs.","AirFrance is without doubt the worst airline I have ever flown with. Their customer service team is abysmal. My partner and I flew to Dubai from Paris on the 25th of October 2024, our flight arrive about 3 hours behind schedule and upon arriving at Dubai airport our checked in luggage was nowhere to be seen. I understand baggage goes missing but the baggage did not arrive in Dubai for 72 hours. 

My partner and I were without necessities such as prescribed medication, clothes, and hygiene products for 72 hours. I have since tried to claim expenses for these necessities which equated to roughly €200-€300 but AirFrance will not process anything without receipts. I have sent the airline screenshots of the purchase orders online and tags of the clothes but our receipts were disposed of in the hotel mistakenly and AirFrance will not acknowledge this. What a farce!

And to top it all off, without the bag for 72 hours in an expensive city like Dubai low and behold the bag arrives with a gaping hole in the side of it. I don't even know how someone would be able to damage a bag like this. It is a hardcase Swissport luggage suitcase. I have been in contact with AirFrance claim for about 7 days now to resolve this and once again, they will not do anything as we have 'no receipts' - How am I supposed to have receipts for a bag that was purchased more than a year ago and has nothing got to do with the damage caused. 

Their customer service team are the most unhelpful group of individuals I have ever dealt with. I would strongly encourage anyone who is contemplating flying with AirFrance to think again in the future. I have taken a serious financial burden from their mishaps and they are doing nothing about it.

Avoid AirFrance!","2024-11-05"
"5","One of the best airlines in the world","Pros:
1. Food quality (the food was brilliant)
2. Comfort (there was ample room despite being economy class)
3. Service (great service offered)
4. Value (makes sense when the rest are so good)","2024-11-03"
"2","Legroom and seats are as small as Spirit or United","The legroom is awful. It is as small as United. The seats are tiny, similar to Spirit or another budget airline. The food was okay, as we only recieved a snack for a seven hour flight.  The flight attendants were very nice. On the return trip, they left a snack bar open during the flight. If you can avoid this airline for a long flight, I would.","2024-11-03"
"2","OVER RATED AIRLINE & DISRESPECTFUL STAFF TO NON FRENCH PASSENGERS","OVER RATED AIRLINE- 2/5
As a Million Mile Plus flyer, having traveled to most continents and 50 countries, I find Air France to be BELOW AVERAGE, Mainly because of the way their staff talk down to, about and speak disrespectfully about NON FRENCH passengers.

My Asian wife is Fluent in 5 languages and I am fluent in 3 languages, and both heard staff not only speak disrespectfully and derogatory about me, but many other passengers,  mostly American citizens.

Dress Down
I always dress down for flight, which my wife dislikes, usually fly in Business, not available for this flight. I am a Multimillion who owns 14 rental complexes on the East Coast of the U.S, but don't look like it by the way I dress.

Staff 2/5
At the counter and on the plane, their arrogance, talking down to and about us, when they think we DON'T understand French

RDU to CDG Flight 
Staff
Again,  talking in French about passengers in a negative mocking manner, when they don't think you understand, ESPECIALLY if you are American

Landing(Pilot)
ROUGH & HARD, maybe time to go back to the training simulator.

OVERALL 2/5
Despite being a code share with Delta, I would NOT fly  Air France again !","2024-11-02"
"1","Disgusted","Staff are incredibly rude.  Had a French staff person call me out of line insisting my carry on bag was too large and absolutely had to be checked at the gate; it was not.  They proceeded to walk away then threatened to change my flight while I was trying to understand what the issue was.  I expressed concerns of checking the bag as it contained medically necessary equipment that I could not risk losing on an extended overseas trip.  They continued to threaten to switch my flight.  They also insisted I switched the bag expressing, "" that's not the bag! You switched it!"".   I ended up having to get an additional bag, barely any smaller, to put my medical equipment in so they could check my original bag.  Obviously, this just meant more space was taken up on the aircraft which made no sense. While navigating this unfortunate experience, I took note that this person was intentionally instigating similar situations with those she interpreted to be American.  When I arrived at my seat, there was a French patron who brought his ""checked"" carry on onboard and placed in the bin I've my seat but staff did not remove it from the overhead bin.  I understand a lot of other nationalities do not care for Americans and expected a certain level of attitude, but I'm honestly blown away by the extreme levels of rudeness and discrimination, especially by staff in a service-based industry.  

The in-flight experience was no better than any domestic US flight.  For an eight hour flight, it was incredibly cramped and the cabin temperature was uncomfortable.  The food was less than unimpressive.  And, as for the staff service on board, it was barely better than the gate service. 

Ultimately, I'm disgusted by this experience and am hoping beyond hope that my return flight with a different airline will be much improved.","2024-11-01"
"5","Air france for finacial masacists","Air france best scammers in the world.
they not only rip you off and flease you for all your flight they sell it to some body else.","2024-11-01"
"1","Customer Support - Avoidance Tactics","I am incredibly shocked at the level of avoidance tactics by Air France.  After a botched flight for a conference where my baggage arrival was delayed by 2 days, I was entitled to receive compensation in accordance with EU passenger rights.  Air France processed and accepted my claim agreeing to compensate financially as per EU law.  But... the money was never received.  After numerous attempts to contact customer support - complete silence.  Only a response that the case is ""closed"".  Numerous calls to customer support - their response is always the same - the payment will be done shortly.  Its been more than a year since the claim.  No information as to why they did not yet pay out despite written confirmation of their intent to wire compensation on the claim. I proceeded with legal action and their headquarters refuses to receive the notification letter as they need a recipient name in order to accept the letter. But they will not provide the name of any person in either customer support or the legal department.  They are doing anything they possibly can to avoid accountability.  I am amazed at the resilience.  They are playing a game of endurance hoping you will just lose interest or forget about the claim.  There is NOBODY accountable at Air France and they intentionally make it impossible to escalate - no senior manager to talk to - no replies to emails or claim tickets - no support at headquarters .  They violate passenger rights outright and use these tactics to avoid their liabilities.  The only thing left is litigation.  Too bad for the otherwise excellent work of their cabin crews and flight crews.  I am especially fond of KLM.  But in my own case, it is clear that they will not adhere to their responsibilities when things go wrong.  You are no longer a valued customer - just a liability they hope will disappear.  Keep this in mind next time you book Air France...","2024-11-01"
"1","Unprofessional attitude","The most terrible experience ever had! Very low quality of everything. On top of it the flight attendant let herself shouting, unprofessional attitude!","2024-10-31"
"1","Bad experience","First time I used airfrance from canada to French it's really bad experience with airfrance cheap quality this seats very tight and food no quality too I don't like it at all and will never fly with them again ever!!!!!!!","2024-10-30"
"3","Terrible customer service","I would not recommend traveling Air France if you are expecting a good customer service. The food constantly runs out and you get whatever they have left, in other words, yes you eat leftovers, and the worst part is that nobody on the crew cares. I was not able to eat at any point in the flight since I am allergic to some vegetables and all that they had left was vegetarian food. A woman in front of me had an issue as well and ñ 3 crew members try to solve her issue and apologized to her only because she spoke French. So, If you speak French it might be a different story, and your issue might get solve.","2024-09-09"
"1","Awful Business class experience never again","My partner and I visited Bangkok, departing from Manchester via Amsterdam with KLM. On the outbound journey, we booked premium economy with KLM. The service was so good that we decided it was likely to be similar with Air France, so we opted to upgrade to business class for the return leg.

Regrettably, our assumption that the service would match KLM’s standard couldn’t have been further from the truth. Contrary to what was stated on the Air France website, the 777 we flew on still had the old business class seats. The seats were not clean, and I had to use Dettol to wipe everything down myself. Additionally, the seats appeared worn and in poor condition. I find it extremely unfair that Air France has essentially created a lottery regarding which aircraft have been refitted and which haven’t, while still charging the same fare.

We decided to make the most of the situation and relax with a movie, but even that wasn’t possible. The entertainment system froze repeatedly, making it impossible to watch films or listen to audio.

After lunch, I didn’t see a flight attendant in the business class cabin for several hours. Unlike the KLM flight where constant refreshments were offered in premium economy, no such service was provided by Air France. When we did ask, the older male flight attendant seemed visibly frustrated by the request, which made us feel like a nuisance. Despite pressing the call bell, the flight attendants either didn’t come, walked straight past, or took 20 minutes to respond, only after being flagged down. We spent the entire flight thirsty. I later found the flight attendants sitting around, laughing in the mid-galley with the curtains drawn. Eventually, I was told I could help myself to a banana and an orange from the forward galley and pour my own water. From that point on, it felt like the business class cabin was practically abandoned, with passengers getting up and helping themselves.

When dinner was finally served, it was rushed due to turbulence. The meal was basic, accompanied by warm, flat Coke, and no alcohol was offered. The reason given was that the turbulence didn’t allow enough time to serve drinks, but I don’t buy into that. From my knowledge of aviation, pilots would have been warned about the turbulence through TAF reports and ride reports from other pilots.

In conclusion, it’s a real shame that KLM has partnered with Air France, as I will now avoid booking with either airline in the future. I refuse to pay for business class tickets when the service is better in economy.

Perhaps when Air France completes its cabin refresh and starts caring about its passengers again, I might reconsider. Until then, I’ll stick with Emirates.","2024-09-08"
"1","Nightmare! Never fly Air France!","I travelled with my daughter for the summer hols, from Jeddah to Washington via CDG. The flight from Jeddah was delayed 4 hours, causing us to miss connecting flight from CDG. We were told that we will be put up in a hotel for the night, and on the flight next morning. On reaching the hotel, they had no information about this. We had wait until late night, till this was resolved. I  was with my young daughter without spare clothes and medication. The next day, I realized that they only confirmed one ticket to Washington.  When we finally got on the flight, we were not given the seats we paid for. Furthermore, when we reached Washington, our baggage was delayed. We were in the same clothes for 2 days. The whole ordeal was a big loss and an absolute disaster. I was told at IAD airport that I would be reimbursed. But Air France has denied reimbursement and are now ignoring my claims and emails. There is no way to speak to anyone. They lied about reimbursement, and are taking no responsibility for the consequences, loss and damage caused. Never fly Air France !!!!","2024-09-08"

*  Good professional international airline
*  The national carrier of France, providing international service

CONS
Flying is not an enjoyable experience

""I VISITED THIS PLACE""...
... because it provided direct non stop flight for the destinations that I needed.  I enjoyed the flight but the disembarking and getting to the terminal and getting the luggage at IAD was long and exhaisting and tedious- none of this being the airline's fault nor resonsibility

WAS IT WORTH THE COST?

"1","Horror show","We booked on Delta.  Air France flew the second leg of the flight from Paris to Nairobi.  They were a horror show.  The plane experienced mechanical issues as it was taxiing out to the runway.  Instead of deplaning, Air France kept us on the plane on the tarmac for over 2 hours before deciding that the plane could not be used.  They scheduled a new flight four hours later.  We then deplaned with the promise of a free lunch on Air France and were told that the restaurant food services would be informed and we had to do nothing else.  Not so.  We had to wait in line for a voucher.  Some people found this out only after they had eaten their meals and could not be reimbursed.  We boarded the new flight and sat on the plane for almost 2 hours before being told that they could not take off because they would arrive in Nairobi too late to land.  We were given incorrect instructions as to where to go to find out about rebooking and accommodations.  We and the other exhausted passengers walked about the airport until some kind sole told us where to go.  Air France put us up in a residential building without a restaurant on premises or nearby.  We had to walk nearly a mile in the airport to reach the shuttle to the building.  They gave us a bagged dinner that consisted of a premade sandwich, a juice box and some non-descript pastry.  Welcome to France.  They rebooked us through Dubai (instead of a direct flight) on an African airline two days later, claiming that this was the earliest that we would be able to reach Nairobi.  And, because our flight originated in the US, they refused to pay us any compensation for either of the two cancelled flights.","2024-09-04"
"1","Avoid Air France and KLM at All Costs","My journey began on June 28th, a seemingly ordinary day until my baggage vanished into the labyrinth of airline logistics. My flight from Marrakech, Morocco, to New York marked the start of a frustrating ordeal that would test my patience and resilience.

Upon arrival, I discovered my luggage was nowhere to be found. I immediately filed a claim at JFK Terminal 1, obtaining a claim number and a phone number to call. Despite repeated attempts, I was unable to reach anyone by phone. Frustrated, I even took  cabs to the airport multiple times in hopes of getting answers, but there was no trace of my baggage.

Despite repeated attempts to contact Air France and KLM customer service, I received little to no assistance. The initial shock soon turned into a mounting sense of frustration as days turned into weeks with no sign of my belongings.

As time passed, my anxiety grew. My suitcase contained essential items, including toiletries, clothing, and valuable electronics. Without my belongings, I felt stranded and unable to fully enjoy my trip.

After a staggering 56 days of waiting, I finally retrieved my baggage upon my return to Marrakech on August 22nd. However, upon inspection, I was appalled to discover that the suitcase had been significantly damaged. The contents were scattered. I was dismayed to discover that the airline had gone through the contents of my suitcase without my consent. They had merely needed to match the bag tag, a task that could have been easily accomplished without violating my privacy.

The airline's violation of its own policy regarding lost baggage (after 45 days), coupled with their lack of urgency and evasive tactics, have left me feeling frustrated and disrespected. I believe their primary concern was to avoid responsibility rather than resolve my issue. Their handling of delayed baggage claims is unacceptable, and I have no confidence in their ability to provide adequate customer service.","2024-09-04"

The LA staff was wonderful, but in Paris she encountered a rude flight attendant which this irritated me when I found out that she was rude to my daughter because my daughter is one of the sweetest little girls in the world, and traveling by herself we are trusting these people to be professional with our children, and paying an extra fee for their services for them to take care of my daughter while this flight attendant, I wish I knew her name my daughter says she doesn’t recall the ladies name because she was in shock while this lady was screaming at her for asking a simple question, she simply asked if the WiFi and the games were free. I don’t think anyone deserves to get yelled at for a simple question especially a child. Never expected that kind of behavior from an Air France employee, disappointed, and hurt because I trusted them with my child.","2024-09-01"
"1","Poor aircraft cleanliness, broken facilities and lack of customer engagement.","Find an alternative carrier. Returning to Abu Dhabi from a vacation in Europe and decided to use Air France as their schedule best suited our plans, NEVER AGAIN. 
As this is approximately a 7 hour flight we paid an additional premium for extra leg room seats (16A-16B), however, on boarding we found 16B was both damp and dirty with food waste still evident on and around the seat. This was pointed out to the cabin crew who provided some wet wipes for me to clean the seat myself, stating they would come and look once they had time (which never happened). I sat on the night blanket for the duration of the flight as a barrier to avoid sitting in the damp portion of the seat!!!
The whole row area 16A -16C had clearly not been cleaned to any standard (as can be seen by provided photos).
When the meal service arrived we found the in built table was also broken (photo provided) on seat 16A and would not support the tray of food or drink, which necessitated a balancing act to eat!! Again this was pointed out to the crew at the time. 
The whole aircraft appeared worn and dirty and the two toilets which we used were a test of our smell tolerances, as they had an overpowering smell of urine.
We raised an official complaint to AF requesting a refund of only the additional charges that had been levied for these seats due to their condition. This was dismissed by what appeared to be an auto generated response (AI)..! 
We are frequent flyers taking on average 15 flights a year using many different airlines, however, the standard onboard AF was well below what we would expect on other airlines especially Middle Eastern airlines. 
We will avoid AF in the future.","2024-09-01"

We had a flight from Seattle to Paris and a connection flight from Paris to Barcelona. When we first got on the flight from Seattle to Paris they had us waiting at the terminal for over an hour, and due to the disorganized traffic and badly managed policies at SeaTac and Air France’s crew, we missed our connection flight from Paris to Barcelona by 5 minutes. Exhausted after running around the whole airport, which we  were told by one of the flight attendants that it was going to be a “short” walk. When we found the Air France service counter, and when we spoke to the people there, they treated us like absolute nothing- not understanding that the customers’ satisfaction needs to go first. I personally can’t believe that these people even HAD! the audacity to treat us this way and how they were showing their true colors was just so upsetting and nerve-racking to see. We also asked to speak to the manager MULTIPLE! times and that so called “manager” never ended up coming. They offered to get us tickets to Barcelona later in the day and unfortunately the cruise ship would have already left by the time we have arrived, and they acted so surprised and showed no remorse to us. We asked if they can find us a flight to the cruise’s first stop in Seville, and they said that we would have to pay €1357 PER PERSON!!! We told them that since it was their fault that we missed our connecting flight and that THEY! were the ones that had to pay for the “damages” and they basically gave us the “middle finger” and sent us on our way. We eventually were able to rebook 2 more flights one from Paris to Barcelona and the other one from Barcelona to Seville, and due to all of this mishap we lost 2 days of our cruise.

So, for your own sanity DO NOT!!!! and I repeat DO NOT!!!!! EVER!!!! fly with Air France.","2024-08-28"
"2","Feels like a budget airline","Air France feels more like a budget airline than a normal one. I recently flew from Paris to Toronto and it sucked. The plane was a bit old but was pretty dirty, there was crumbs on the floor, the food tray was dirty but the most disgusting thing was that, the cupholder was sticky and you could see all the juices and soda dried on to it, (could hear it as well). The seats were uncomfortable and the screen had a crack on it. The movie selection were pretty limited and the system itself was slow. The food was okay but the bread was rock hard. Overall Air France is a very subpar airline and would recommend KLM instead","2024-08-28"
"5","Great airline with impeccable service!","From start to finish an A Class service.  Check in in Frankfurt was a breeze, CDG is a mess of an airport, however great AF lounge.  Loved the service on the flight.  Attentive staff, excellent food and excellent selection of drinks.  Good selection of in flight movies.","2024-08-28"
"1","Worst Experience Ever! Not recommended to anyone.","I recently had a disappointing experience with Air France when my baggage was lost during a flight. Despite my efforts to work with their customer service team to resolve the issue, I was met with resistance and a lack of cooperation in obtaining a refund for the lost items. The airline staff need to have training again, about how to talk with customer. I believe Air France is hiring uneducated people to work in their company.  The airline's refusal to take responsibility for the mishandling of my baggage was frustrating and left me feeling undervalued as a customer. I urge Air France Airlines to improve their policies and procedures for handling lost baggage situations to better serve their passengers in the future.","2024-08-28"
"1","Air France, where lying is corporate policy","Screen was broken on a brand new A350 on a twelve-hour flight . Airline promised all sorts of compensation, didn't deliver. Customer service stopped responding to my email enquiries. A garbage airline, where lying seems to be the norm. Next flight I went with Iberia. Much better experience.

By failing to follow up on something that would have cost them £100 they lost revenue of £1,500. I know they don't care. As I said, garbage airline.","2024-08-28"
"1","Bad Airline","They cancel our flight 3 hours before departure due to fleet shortage which it doesn’t make sense and they did not do anything about it, we had to wait 48 hours no hotel was provided. Never again and it’s not the first time we have a problem with Airfrance","2024-07-17"
"1","Terrible airline!!","We got a cancellation notification few hours before our international travel while the car driver traveled 2 hours to pick us up from our location to the airport but we had to apologize and rebook 2 days later as the following day was also canceled. This had put the family under lot of stress due to the time sensitive plans we had in the destination and we had to rework these plans!!  Later we knew the reason was fleet shortage!!!!!
Also the meal was bad; only pasta offered as they mentioned they ran out of chicken although we were in one of the front rows!!  Overall the meals were very bad compared to other airlines.
It was also very warm inside the plane from US  and although I notified the attendant but nothing changed!!!","2024-07-17"
"1","Terrible customer service","Booked two seats with good legroom together with my wife. They last minute placed me between two strangers. When we tried to change it they would only offer use worse seats or make us pay an additional 580$ each to upgrade to economy plus. No other options and 3 days before we leave so we can’t make any more plans. 

We’ve had the displeasure of flying with Air France twice in two years and they pulled the same thing on us both times. 

If you book specific seats with this airline, there’s a good chance you won’t get them so watch out.","2024-07-16"
"1","Just like flying Spirit Airline","on July 17, my family and I were traveling to Paris for vacation. When we arrive at the Airport, Air France sold our seats. We were bumped to a later flight. Mind you we purchased our tickets 5 months in advance. We booked a car service to pick us up, we had to e-mail and call to reschedule. The agent at the counter did not care, did not show any empathy as if it was our fault that they overbooked. we asked for a manager, he was the rudest.  It was very inconvenient and very disappointing. When you spend more money to travel you expect to receive great customer service, it was not the case. They were horrible, just like flying Spirit Airline.","2024-07-15"
"1","Bags broken into during Air France layover","Our bag was broken into in Paris CDG airport on a long layover during an Air France flight. Thankfully we did not have anything of value to be stolen but it was the principle of it and the invasion of privacy. Our padlock has been damaged and the zip of the bag had been forced open then zipped back across causing permanent damage to the zipping mechanism. We have asked Air France to look into the security of bags in their care at CDG airport but we were met with a generic customer service response. Poor customer service. This experience has put me off using Air France in the future. Air France - please increase your bag security at airports!","2024-07-11"
"1","Worst airline I’ve ever taken","Worst airline. Third time taking this airline and all times first flight is delayed and my second flight is missed. This time after the first delay made me miss my flight they downgraded me and charged me cause my carry on was overweight. It wouldn’t be considered overweight if they hadn’t downgraded me. 
They then asked me to ask for a refund by contacting the airline. I called so many times and waited hours to no avail on top of submitting a refund claim. No response yet. I will proceed with chargeback via my bank if they don’t refund me in a timely manner.","2024-07-10"
"1","Worst Airline","Worst customer service. My flight was delayed due to Airfrance, i had to wait at the airport for 12hrs for my next flight to tokyo. over 30hrs of traveling time total.
they did not offer any form of compensation. i contacted the claims team and got constantly ignored.","2024-07-10"
"1","Cheating","Why Claim was closed without any explanation about inflight Inconvenience

This is the worst customer service by Air France to ignore customer complaints

Claim was closed without any explanation about inflight Inconvenience and as I had paid for Premium Economy ticket charges and seat provided by airline is not reclining as I had paid euro 7320 for three tickets and airline failed to provide seats and food

As I am follow up with customer service team but it
Seems that it is ignored by customer service team

Air FranceKLM having defective air crafts and customer service team is very rude at CDG airport Paris not interested to listen your complaints","2024-07-09"
"1","Bad","Very bad experience with Air France. The flight was cancelled and the ground staff was not helpful at all. They were trying there best to not provide any information and avoid rebooking the passengers to another flights. They wanted passenger to simply book on the same flight next day and expected passengers to stay in the terminal for the whole night.","2024-07-09"
"4","SHORT FLIGHT, GOOED EXPERIENCE THOUGH","A brand new Airbus A220, with a great 2-3 configuration, I paid a bit extra for a window seat. Leg room was good, comfy seats, with power point for my iPhone. 
Made the mistake of plugging in before take off, both myself and my seat companion were both told off and asked to remove them. No announcement or signs warned me this was not permitted. Anyway once cruising, plugged in and powered up. 
Flight was short but crew managed to serve a grain bread sandwich with Emmental, which was nice, and a coke zero, with serviette and cup. Coke was cold. 

As we came in to land, the cabin crew just walked pass my neighbour and pulled out his charging cable again, without saying a word, I did mine straight away out of fear for the dragon of a stewardess. 

Overall though a good experience, and generally nice service, and great aircraft from AF.","2024-07-08"
"1","Do not fly Air France","Absolute worst customer service and flying experience of my life. Not only did Air France lose mine and my friend’s bags, they refused to let us have our bags until after their lunch break. Meaning we arrive back to the airport at 1:02pm but can’t get our luggage until 2. This wasted the whole first day of our trip with going to and from the airport and filing claims. To top it off, the man working the Air France desk and eating a cookie while speaking to me informed me he would not be releasing my luggage until after his break was complete. 0/10 customer service","2024-07-06"
"1","Tremendous ripoff","I did not know if you do not take the first flight automatically the second one gets canceled. My booking status online and in my app didn’t check neither I got an email notifying the cancellation. Moreover, one week before the flight I was able to purchase a checked bag!! Then on the day of the flight, at the desk, they told me my flight was canceled and I had to pay extra 125€. Airfrance took the money from the extra luggage for a cancelled ticket… the worst experience ever.","2024-07-05"
"1","VACATION KILLER!!","VACATION KILLER!  Do NOT use Air France to go to Italy!  They lost our luggage and originally we thought  it was ok because the luggage was deleted to the Rome airport that night, and so that was fine with us. Even though the luggage arrived at the airport the same night, and they said they would bring to us at our apartment, THEY NEVER GAVE US OUR LUGGAGE BACK!  We called and begged them everyday. Everyday they told us it would be delivered and it was not.  We have two young children and it was a nightmare. We are shocked and saddened that a company of this size does business like this. Total vacation killer of what was supposed to be a o ce in a lifetime trip. Do not fly Airfrance!","2024-07-05"
"1","Missing luggage","This airline has my luggage missing for 4days now and i was promised to hear back from them with my luggage within 72hrs yet haven’t received any update. It still shows that it’s being traced. Traced to where when they clearly know very well what is happening to customers luggages. They have cameras with videos that can show what’s happening to customers luggages. Im filing lawsuits against them with my lawyers cause they too agree that this is pathetic and unacceptable behavior towards the customers. I don’t care but we’re going the hardest path with them! This is theft of the highest level and very uncouth!!","2024-07-04"
"1","Food poisoning","Their food gave me food poisoning 5 hours after consuming it. I ended up in the hospital for vomiting and diarrhea. Just don’t fly with them if you value your health.","2024-07-03"
"1","No more Air France","Air France treats customers poorly. If you need assistance like a wheelchair you are humiliated and treated like a child. You must deplane after everyone or your service is cancelled unlike the US where you can deplane any time and a chair awaits you right outside the plane door. Staff have no patience for questions at the airport desks and just keep telling you that everything will be ok even through we all know the Paris airport is impossible to navigate without assistance and that wheelchairs sometimes do not show up!!  They refuse to acknowledge problems, issues, anxieties, or mistakes. They have no capacity for empathy at all but are rude and dismissive. Our first and last Air France trip.","2024-07-03"
"3","Comfy Seating, but Skimpy Carry-On Weight Limits.","The flight had a highlight with seating, but there was a major negative issue with carry-on baggage, which I'll address in a moment.  First off, the flight was on a 777 and the seating was as good or better than any other standard airline seat I've experienced.  Very good steep reclining comfort.  Leg room was average or above.  This was a long flight, which included two meals.  Main meal (turkey dish) was good. This being a French company, the 2nd meal was mostly different small packages of bread & yogurt.  They served only beer and wine, so rum and coke was not an option. Delta put us on this flight after a missed connection due to air traffic and we were surprised to find that Air France has a very strict 12 KG (26.4 lb) total carry-on weight limit per passenger (Delta does not).  My small suitcase and computer bag totaled slightly over 28 lbs. so the suitcase had to be checked for an additional cost. Same with my wife and this cost about $130 extra that Delta wouldn't cover.","2024-07-02"
"1","Don’t give them your carryon! You will not see it again!","They took my carryon from the flight and promise to give me at arrival and disappeared. Finally back home without and  then told me to pay $250 to send it. I never ever use and recommended Air France to anyone. Terrible service, food and you may be robbed like me at the end.","2024-07-01"
"1","The worst customer service and 0 respect!","The worst airlines! Avoid it! 0 customer service, all staff of airfrance having a bad attitude and rude. We traveled from Paris to Abu Dhabi, it was the worst flight. We arrived on time to CDG airport (very bad too ) and found out that our tickets for flight were canceled due the reason we didn't use the train, while we arrived by car. However in the airport Air France staff was chantaging us saying ""You wanna fly you must pay the fine""! And we have no choice because they were not trying to help us or understand the situation. We paid 500 Euro each, we didn't get any receipts for those payments. After they were doing everything do no let us to catch the flight! Worst worst airlines! Dont travel with them! 0 is a compliment for their unprofessional and careless work! We ended up paying almost 2000 euro for this bad airline! SHAME!!","2024-06-29"
"5","A relaxing flight","My husband and I had planned our holiday to Mauritius for some time. 

Boarding was slightly late but efficient and we were soon offered all the amenities. 
We had the middle seats together.

The staff were attentive and effective.

Food was delicious and we soon settled in for the overnight flight.

Breakfast was also excellent.

Our luggage was offloaded and collected quickly and we were soon on our way to teh hotel.","2024-06-29"

"1","Better wait 24 hrs at airport if your flight from Air France get delayed","Delay in flight from Milan to Paris so miss the flight from Paris to Hong Kong. After arriving in Paris waited 2 hrs for hotel arrangements and then 1 hr for the shuttle to come and take us to hotel. Other passengers told me it was not the first time to them. After this experience I will NEVER try this company. The next flight is 24 hours apart and they compensate us with a hotel room near airport until 12 noon and expect us to do nothing until the flight at 11pm. All extra expenditures 
in Paris were not conpensated except a meal. After this experience I will NEVER try this company. NEVER","2024-05-20"
"5","Helpful staff","Having missed our flight to Barcelona with vueling, a female member of staff was so helpful and made our onward journey easy
I cannot thank you enough, I'm sorry we didn't get your name but it was a young ladie on your check in desk, she's a credit to your company, if all everyone was like this person we would be all better for it, well done keep it up.","2024-05-20"

BLR to DFW.  AF 191 delayed by 2 hours made the paris flight to miss and then lost one of the baggage. What most we can expect from this!!","2024-05-19"

Multiple calls to their customer service centre resulted in nothing. The phone people literally said they could do nothing about it.","2024-05-19"
"5","Pros, cons and advices on my experience of great airline and great staff!!","PROS
*  Good fine international airline
*  Good clean airplane 
*  Good service and good food
*  Good entertainment
*  Fantastic helpful caring on line telephone staff
*  Very respectable price for multileg journey of TLV-CDG-IAD-CDG-TLV

CONS 
CDG airport is big but signage is OK

 ""I VISITED THIS PLACE""...  
... because I wanted to go to Paris to visit the Musee d'Orsay for the 150th commemoration of the impressionist art exhibitions, and then to continue to Washington DC.

This airline offered the best price and a nonstop flight for each segment.

The telephone staff were incredibly useful and helpful.  The airplane staff also.

The flight left on time and arrived on time.

The middle section aisle seat that I secured was good, except for the one person next to me, who coughed with sputum the entire time, but I wore a mask and decided that this elderly somewhat unkempt man had a chronic bronchitis which was not infectious, and I did not get sick.

 WAS IT WORTH THE COST?
It most certainly was

 WOULD ""I VISIT THIS PLACE"" AGAIN?
Yes- this is a preferred airline for me and I enjoy going to Paris

 ADVICE
*  Consider this airline
*  Join the ""Flying Blue"" and get credit for KLM activity too, and maybe also ITA","2024-05-18"

"3","Very Disappointing","We flew Business Class from CDG to LAX. It was a disappointing experience. Announcements in English were barely comprehensible, from the Captain to the flight attendants. Why can’t they speak slowly in English when they have such heavy accents?

Seats were quite hard and it was comfortable only when fully reclined. The seat cushions had the feel of economy seating.

Service was above average, so kudos to the flight attendants for their smiles and professionalism. Beverages and food were sub-standard. I was looking forward to their Pommard Champagne, but it was at room temperature pre-departure and during the flight. The same for white wine. I asked the flight attendant about it and he just said “desole, monsieur”. This was a real bummer for me. Why can’t they pre-chill these items which are so iconically French?  For lunch we started with an appetizer of a tiny maybe 2” square plate of cream cheese, hazelnut and pine nut crumble. It was disgusting. Would have preferred nuts. The Shrimp Starter was bland. I selected the Crab and Shrimp Ravioles with Breton curry sauce. The “raviole” was one big ravioli (odd) vs the little square ones I’m used to, and it did not have a heavy seafood taste. The only thing that saved the dish was the wonderful curry sauce. Prior to arrival we had Chicken fillet with tomato sauce, a dish that was fairly dry.  The bread roll was hard and dry, obviously past its prime. The disappointing “dessert” was a Madeleine sponge cake which was a dry spongy mess. 

Overall, we were disappointed in the onboard seating experience, the food, and the Champagne and white wine served at room temperature.","2024-05-17"
"5","Air France are good and quite stable!","Copenhagen-Paris 16th May. 2024 on a A320. Checked in on-line but to no avail, as luggage has to be checked in anyway. Check in refused to transfer my luggage to the next leg of journey, which was extremely inconvenient for transit in Paris and costed me at least an hour of extra struggle. Previously, AF in CPH often checked in my luggage to final destination. However, this service is obviously unpredictable, depending on who sits at the counter. The station manager tried and even took over the checking in. However, eventually she declined as she failed to identify any AF agreement with the concerned (next) airline: Rwandair. Boarding smooth, full flight; on time; luggage arrived well in Paris. Onboard, given emergency seat, fast track. Given access to “Apartment lounge” in Copenhagen due to FB status. This lounge is not worldclass, but is nowadays likely the best in CPH airport concerning food and drinks. Onboard, no free WiFi and no IFE. FAs were good and provided two rounds of cold sandwiches and most sorts of drinks. Wines were acceptable. Respected by FAs as Flying Blue gold card holder and I was well catered for. Could have rated much higher if they would have accepted checking in my luggage beyond Paris.","2024-05-17"
"1","Awful Air France","The single worst airline in the world.
Rude staff. 
Crap food. 
Cramped conditions. 
Dirty. 
Hard flat seats.
Lost luggage.
If they could get it wrong, they got it wrong
Avoid this airline at all costs","2024-05-16"
"2","Bad communication and connection help","The food and the service was okay - the worst part was that we had an hour delay and wouldn’t have our connecting flight have 30 min delay we wouldn’t get the flight. Also after asking the crew if the connecting gate were close by, they said it’s “just” 20min “walk”. But we had to drive the train, skipped the line in the security and passport check and we were running for the way between this points and we still needed 20 min. Means would we “just walked” then we would have needed for this whole gate switch 1 to 1,5 h 

The information of the AirFrance crew was more than just helpless and they were not wanted to call the another flight to make them wait - the comment was “if you not get there in time, then it is what it is” 

I will for sure not recommend this disrespect behavior and airline.","2024-05-16"
"1","premium price for budget service","Total waste of money to use this company. Especially booked air france and paid 120 euro more to avoid 2 separate tickets from 2 companies. Then they have the flight carried out by one of their budget sister companies with a crappy plane that couldn't depart due to technical problems. Missed connecting flight. No service whatsoever. Arrived 4 hours late to a meeting on a total travel time of 3 hours. No compensation, nothing. Had been better of driving the car.","2024-05-15"
"1","Separated people in the same family sitting next to one another","My wife and I paid over $8,000 for business class tickets to Auckland from LAX.  We reserved our seats a month ahead of time, sitting next to one another.  When we checked in, I had been moved by 7 rows.  The reason being that there was a disabled person who needed to sit next to his companion.  I am 100% good with changing seats for this, but why on earth did they separate two people who were on the same ticket (record locator), with the same last name, who were sitting next to one another????  Why not move two strangers who were next to each other???

I sent in a complaint via their website and was told that their rules allowed them to do this and that I was owed no compensation.  I never asked for compensation - why on earth would they go out of their way to tell me that they assigned zero value to this issue.  Thanks, Air France.","2024-05-13"
"1","Bagage perdu lors de mon vol avec escales","I recently took a trip from Marseille to Paris, then to Singapore and finally to Sydney. Unfortunately, my suitcase appears to have been misplaced during transit at the Singapore airport due to an agent's error. When I arrived in Sydney, my suitcase was declared lost. For the past seven days, I have been making enormous efforts to contact the two airlines, Air France and Qantas, who are passing the blame on each other without taking any proactive action to find my suitcase. The only compensation I have received so far is a basic necessities kit containing a T-shirt, a toothbrush and a razor. I feel abandoned without advice or follow-up on the progress of my claim for over a week. This way of treating customers is unacceptable! I have a wedding in Australia for which I need my clothes contained in my suitcase. I am extremely frustrated by this situation and by the lack of professionalism displayed by the company.
Looking forward to a prompt and proactive response from you regarding this unpleasant situation.","2024-05-12"
"1","Worst airline ever","As an Airline Pilot myself, I understand the frustration that comes with passengers bringing a large quantity of baggage. I also understand the reason airlines prefer less bags and charge for additional weight/pieces. As I booked my parents standby to and from India, we didn't know in advance what airline they would be returning with(along with baggage restrictions) based on loads, until shortly before their return. The issue in this circumstance is that they were charged a total of $980 Canadian for 2 legs which we believe is an unreasonable amount. It appears that Air France has decided to just charge whatever they want to maximize profit with little regard for customer service and a positive experience for guests, especially ones travelling interline.
Here is the experience from my parents point of view:
Our trip with Air France started in Delhi, India where we were booked to fly to Paris and then to Vancouver on 29th Feb, 2024
Although the Staff at Indian Airport was very friendly, they did charge for extra suitcases for me and my wife, from Delhi to Vancouver at $120 CAD each.
We each had a cabin briefcase and a personal item with us which was allowed without any issue.
Interestingly my itinerary mentioned the flight departure at 1:45 AM as well as the online check-in, but the boarding pass indicated the time as 5:15 AM.
I confirmed the flight time by calling Air France office in Delhi and confirmed the time as 5:15 AM which means that my connecting flight from Paris to Vancouver was no longer an option for me. The Paris-Vancouver flight was already departing by the time we reached Paris.
Our son booked us to Vancouver via Los Angeles through Air France and then through WestJet from Los Angeles to Vancouver.
The customer service at Paris Airport was the worst we have ever seen. No one was really ready to talk to you if you didn't speak French. While booking our luggage again at Paris to Los Angeles , we were asked to pay for 2nd suitcase again. We showed them the paper that we have already paid for the extra suitcase at Delhi Airport so they let us go.
While going through the line for security check we were directed to another place and asked to weigh cabin case and personal bag together and were told that the weight is more than 12kg so we have to go back and book the cabin cases. We tried to explain that we are interline standby travelers and we are already connecting through an Air France flight where it was not an issue, but the person there was not ready to listen to us nor was he talking to us in English. He just kept pushing us to go and book our cabin bags.
We had to go back and book our cabin briefcases and they charged us an excessive amount for that (240 Euro for each of the 2 cabin briefcases)  
We wanted to talk to someone and raise our concerns but no one was ready to talk to us or listen to us , probably because we were English speaking.

As someone in the industry, I believe it would be hard to justify this amount. I look forward to your response and a chance for Air France to show they do value fairness and most importantly, customer service.

After filing a complaint on their website, AF has been having us jump through hoops, utilizing delay tactics and refusal to allow communication with a supervisor. The claim is still pending with no real response.","2024-05-11"
"1","Avoid this company, one of the worst customer services I ever experienced","Terrible experience with Air France. Have tried to book flights for my elderly parents using their senior pass. My mum's pass is not recognised when I book online. I have called the senior pass team, sent them screenshot etc. They never replied. The worst was that I called the helpline to book over the phone, I was told that they could not book the flights over the phone, someone else told me I should book my mum's and dad's flight separetely for the senior pass to work online (which is completely untrue and did not change anything).... multiple phone calls, different answers, until I eventually heavily insisted to get the booking done over the phone...Almost spent an hour , managed to get the flights with the senior fares  but still had to pay the extra-fees for over-the-phone booking. I was supposed to receive the tickets by email after paying online, did not receive them. I had to call them again a week later and they eventually sent me the tickets. Then I realised I didn't book the travel insurance, called them 3 times during the day; again various excuses from different staff (one said they had a technical issues-after keeping me waiting many times and promised someone would call me back from the support, it never happened. Called again, I was told to call Allianz and was promised they were open which was not true, and the third person said I could not because I didn't have a booking and later said, that I could not because I already had my tickets...A nightmare. Avoid this company. The customer service is a disaster. No one has any clue what they are doing. Moreover, they absolutely don't care about you.","2024-05-11"
"4","Good flight with Air France","Was a good flight. The staff was nice and the food was okay. The leg room was as expected and everything worked well. Would recommend.","2024-05-09"
"2","Cover ups and lies.","Our trip was planned months ago.  I booked PRemium Economy seats through Delta who then assigned us to an Air France flight.  Our flight to Paris was OK, but coming home our troubles started with the gate agent who neglected to tell us our ""assigned"" seats were not available and he changed us to stand by status.   We had no clue until it was time to baord our flight.  Then we are told that one of our seats is ""broken"" and there are no more premium economy seats available.  So I let my friend have the original unbroken assigned seat and I opted for economy (it was that or stay in Paris :() Then my friend is assigned a totally different premium seat instead of the window seat she wanted sitting with me.  She is placed next to a rude man who made the flight uncomfortable.  I move to economy.
Then my friend notices people are sitting in the seats that my email confirmation listed as ours!  So now I feel I was blatantly lied to.  If it were not for physical disabilities we would gladly fly economy but her knees and my asthma are both limiting conditions- so we pay the extra to have space.

Another additional affront occurred when the gate agent was in the middle of helping us when a male demanded attention immediately and she dropped us to deal with him.  

 I could add more, but suffice it to say they are an unreliable airline with cold, uncaring employees","2024-05-08"

"1","Great, as long as you don't have pets or checked bags!","I called Air France BEFORE I booked my flight to enquire specifcally about traveling with a dog and 2 cats, and I was told that I could fly with 2 pets in hold and 1 in cabin. So, I booked the flight. Then they canceled the pet request because the layover was not long enough. So, the agent books a different flight, and they cancelled that one because the plane on one leg of the flight did not allow more than one pet in hold. After literally 20 phone calls, and 20 hours of my time attempting to book a flight with my pets, it occurred to me that there are zero flights from Chicago to Turin that will accomodate them. I asked if there were any flights to any nearby airports, and the agents were unable to find even one. I asked for a refund, due to my being given false information regarding travel with pets on this route, they refused, because the 1k flight was non-refundable. I ended up asking which type plane allows more than one pet, and I was able to research and find a flight myself, going into Bologna..... a 5-6 hour drive from where I needed to be. Also keep in mind, when traveling with pets, you must remove your them from the carrier goong through security, or put them through an x-ray machine designed for non-living items. However in Paris, unlike other airports, they do not have a room to remove your pets in, so if your cat doesn't appreciate going back in the carrier, good luck. Luckily my cat ultimately was more afraid of the airport, than he was the carrier, so I only had a few scratches. Then, upon attempting to board the second leg of the flight in Paris, they weighed my carry on PLUS my purse together, and was told it was 1kg to heavy, and I needed to check the carry-on bag.  Except the bag contained a 3k camera and 2k worth of medication, and all my pet supplies, none of which I could ditch. I asked them to document the expensive contents and was told the medicine and pet supplies would be okay, but it would be best not to check the camera. So clearly they are aware their own employees are thieves, and they still work there? Finally a manager came out and made an exception for me to carry it in cabin. However, this process took so long, I missed the connecting flight. So, they had to remove my 60 pound dog and my cat, that were already checked into cargo, and I had to wait in the airport with all 3 of them for an additional 4 hours until the next flight. Of course, they tried to charge me a flight change fee, but as my voice got louder, they decided to do me a huge favor and waive that. Now, I land in Bologna at 23:30, and the rental car was closed, so not only did I pay a day for a rental car that I didn't have, I had to take a $100 cab to a $200 hotel room, then another $100 cab back to the airport in the morning to rent a car, for my 5 hour drive to Turin with 3 animals. On top of this, one of my checked bags didn't make it to Bologna. I suppose I should be grateful they even found it. I received an email on 5 March, stating my bag arrived at Bologna airport. I made arrangments for it to be delivered on 10 March, because although my daughter lives in Bologna and could pick it up, we would still have to get it to Torino. After waiting all day, the bag did not arrive. So, I called Air France to see why it wasn't delivered, and was told my bag was enroute to Bologna from Paris? Then the next day, they told me it did actually arrive on the 5th, so I asked them again to deliver it. They told me they handed it to ONX courier, who will contact me. It us now 14 March, and no word from the courier. I had asked for the courier phone number, and they gave me 2 numbers, one of which is out of service, and one they don't answer. AF refuses to give me an email so that I can contact the company myself, but assured me they would email them, but today they told me the company never responded to the email. So, today 14 March, I called AF and asked that they get my bag back from the courier, and I will take a day to go to Bologna to retrieve it there. Of course, they again emailed the company that clearly has zero employees to answer it. It won't long before it can be deemed lost. Been there, and anyone who has been there can tell you this will entail hours locating receipts and making spreadsheets, only to be told the value of your items are 1/10 of what it would cost to replace them, and if you don't have receipts, you are out of luck (because you know everyone just wants to rip off these honest, ethical airlines when THEY lose YOUR luggage). Bottom line, I am sure this is a perfectly fine Airline to fly international, as long as you do not have pets or checked baggage, as their agents are ill-informed regarding pets, and even if they find your bag after they lost it, they will hand it to a courier that doesn't deliver your bag, answer their phone, or respond emails. After this total nightmare, where my poor cats were traumatized after being crated for 24 hours in urine soaked carriers (I uploaded a photo of one of them, around hour 20), I realize I would have literally saved 50 hours of time, and 1k, had I simply re-booked with a different airline,  cancelling the Air France flight all together, with no refund.","2024-03-15"
"1","Four flights with Air France, only the long distance flight was any good.","The flight was late leaving EDI. The co-pilot appeared to be arguing with ground staff about some problem. This may not have been the airline's fault. Ground crew re positioned air-stairs and eventually we boarded. The plane interior was averagely clean. Disappointing after Emirates and Etihad.
When the back wheels touched the runway in CDG it occurred to me that the nose was still high. Sure enough, the pilot aborted landing and we had to go around.
This may well have been the best and safest thing to do but it meant we lost 20 minutes. This meant out time on the ground was shorter than planned to make out connecting flight..
Our bags, despite being business priority missed the connecting AF flight to Toulouse. It was around lunchtime so maybe ground crew went on lunch.  AF service in TLS was non-existent. Worked my way around entering a contactless form into a terminal. Got an email late in the day saying our bags are on the way late that night and would be available for collection the following day after 9am. I went back to the terminal, after 9 the following morning and was advised by staff that the bags were due in TLS later that day. They insisted the email I had received was wrong.  Lucky I had Apple Airtags in the bags and the airtags were in the terminal. The staff member invited me into the next room and there were our 3 bags. Along with about 100 others.
If I hadn't had airtags I would have been sent away to wait another day.
This is the first flight I have ever had in my life with lost luggage.
The AF service was very poor.
When I spoke to French friends, they told me lost luggage in CDG transfers were very common and they called it Air Chance. Given that both flights were in and out of Terminal 2 at CDG the bags didn't have to go far yet they didn't make it on time.
No apology has ever been received from AF.
Not happy and not likely to use AF again if there is a connecting flight.","2024-03-15"

"1","Avoid Air France at all cost","I just finished an absolutely horrible experience flying to and from India with Air France.  On the way - I missed my connection to India in Paris because my inbound flight was delayed. They decided to route me through Dubai and when I arrived (8 hours later than scheduled) I lost money on my hotel and my bags were delayed for 2 days. Not a word from Air France.  Then on my return, there was a delay on my flight from India to Paris, so they unilaterally decided to route me through SINGAPORE which not only added 20 hours to my flight, but meant that I would miss my connecting flight home to Halifax. Again, not one word from Air France with an offer of assistance or even apology. Finally - today when I sought a claim to compensate for the hundreds of dollars lost AT THEIR EXPENSE - Air France denied any responsibility or compensation because of some obscure law that says my flight was not within the EU so they gave me the middle finger for all my discomfort.  Be aware - never fly Air France if you can avoid it.  They don’t care at all for their customers and when they do completely disrupt their itineraries - they abandon you and any responsibility to help you. Utterly shameful.","2024-03-11"
"1","Over priced! Worst airline in the World!","We were on AF 1269 / AF460 from Manchester to France then switched to another plane for the long leg to Sao Paulo Brazil. Overpriced worst airline ever! Staff were rude and unhelpful. Food was terrible and inadequate. Inflight entertainment was out dated and poor quality. The aeroplane was tired and in need of repair. The area we sat in was filthy and in my opinion unhygienic. Air conditioning was at minimal if any. There were too many discrepancies to mention. Will never fly this poor quality airline EVER again as long as I live!","2024-03-11"

"1","An airline that you would recommend to someone who wants to cut ties with","1. The in-flight meal is really bad. Only bad bread and butter are served. And they don't give me snacks in the middle, and even the snack self-bar has only juice, water, and cola.

2. I had paid in advance and designated a seat. But they changed seats on their own without prior notice. The reason was that the seat I bought was originally not for sale. Then, they assigned me a broken seat that doesn't fit backwards. I sat at 90 degrees during a long flight and came uncomfortable. I asked the customer service center, but I received only a partial response that a refund was not possible. Why did you get an additional fee? And if a seat is not supposed to be sold in the first place, shouldn't you have not sold it? I'm so frustrated.

3. taking the delay for granted.

4. Fortunately, I didn't lose my luggage, but there are many people around me who lost their luggage using Air France

5. Check-in baggage is not added to the ticket fare. Isn't it natural to include at least 15kg of check-in baggage in the basic fare? I've been on more than 40 flights, and I've never seen an airline tell me to add check-in costs.","2024-03-10"

"2","AF Premium economy -- Not on par with French culinary tradition","Premium Econonmy on AF Airbus 350, CDG-ORD

The seats are actually comfortable, and a great improvement over the horrible ones
in the old configuration of the 777s.

However, the food is not what one expects on AF. They served chunks of scallops 
which were passable, but accompanied by essentially nothing, a few snacks full of 
salt as appetizer, an inedible thing pretending to be dessert. The glass of champagne as pre-dinner drink was OK, but the wine served with the meal (white) was nothing short of a disgrace for a company pretending to be French and to showcase the
country's food and wine tradition of excellence. The bottle was labeled ""Vin de France""... it says it all. It was so bad I could not finish it. Perhaps it is great to unplug 
a kitchen sink, but that is about it. I remember when AF served nothing but
""AOC -- Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée"" even in Steerage.
They offered an after-dinner drink called ""poire"" (pear liquor), and I was expecting 
something in the excellent tradition of ""Poire Williams"", a renown white alcohol
from Eastern France. There came a kind of orange liquid, essentially tasteless except
for too much sugar, which again I could not finish.

Air France flies the same planes as the competition; they do not go any faster.
If they want to win passengers' loyalty, they need to provide a soft-product experience along the lines of the fully deserved exceptional reputation
 of French food and drink.","2024-03-09"
"1","Extremely rude and intimidating check in staff at CDG","Extremely rude staff at the check in desk. Avoid this air line at all costs. Low cost budget airlines are more respectful and helpful.

Service was professional, courteous and always with a smile on the face. On board entertainment had numerous alternatives with latest movies and series.

My safari tour company arranged to pick my bags up at the airport and ship them to me for a cost of $250. AF would not reimburse me for the cost; a minimal expense for them that would have gone a long way to make my son and I happier customers.","2024-03-07"

"1","AirFrance Terrible Customer Service","Air France delayed my flight without letting me know. I had to check my confirmation to see it was delayed. Because of the delay I would miss my train to Lyon Part Dieu which I purchased with them as well. After spending more then two hours on the phone the night before they said they cannot get me to my destination and that I can either go to Paris and figure out how to get there on my own or cancel my entire trip. This was about 12 hours before departure and cancelling was not a option so I rushed and bought a new train ticket with my own money. Upon arriving at the airport the next day AirFrance then said they can get me to Lyon Airport which they did not say the night before, therefore wasting my money. Its very sad that this situation happened. Also I needed to spend additional money to get from Lyon Airport to my original destination. 16 days later I hear from AirFrance and they said they cannot help me and no apologies. On top of that my flight home was delayed as well. This is the worst experience I have ever had with a airline.","2024-03-07"
"2","Not a great experience","I traveled on a multi-trip with Air France. First of all, flights got changed so many times, it was hard to plan our activities. We took a 14 hour flight from Singapore to Paris, only get fed twice upon take off and upon landing. The food was ordinary and nobody checked in on passengers to offer drinks or snacks. I was dehydrated and when I asked for water, I was informed to go to the kitchenette and help myself to drinks. When I got there were no cups and they were out of water. I was so sick by the time the flight was over. 

on arriving upon my destination in Portugal, my combination lock had been tampered with and I couldn't open my luggage. I'm not sure why that would happen with a TSA approved lock. ? Also, my friend's luggage was slashed with a knife. 

Upon our return flight - My friend was hit with 500 euros in order to board the flight, even though she had already paid for her flights in full. Their reasoning was that she had missed one leg of a multi trip flight, therefore needs to pay to board this leg of the flight. There is nothing in the policy that states this. 

Based on our experiences in this trip, we will not be flying air France again.","2024-03-06"

"1","Shameful !!","Hello,

Since no one answered or cared for weeks!!!, I will have to share this through social media and all other channels , maybe I'll have some fair and Deserved attention.

Here's the details.

Reference number: UCN2VB
Name: Sahak Dermesrobian 
Flying blue number: 5143 478 873

•My return flight from Beirut to Paris was canceled , then they rescheduled us to another flight to Paris.

• they said that we have enough time to take our connection flight from Paris to Montreal Canada ( didn't tell the truth, which is very bad legally and ethically). we told them we don't have time to take our connection flight (after they rescheduled since the original got canceled), they answered  i qoute here "" our system is update , Don't worry you have two hours in Paris to take your connection flight ""

•We arrived to Paris and our connection flight to Montreal was already gone in the air !!! ( even though in Lebanon they confirmed that we have two hours, telling lies in this senstive situation is dangerous and illegal behavior) 

• we suffered a lot in Paris and slept there one night ( we were three, all reservations were made by me with my Air France account) 

• To make things even worse, i forgot my backpack inside the airplane  in the fligh from Lebanon to Paris ( flight 565) I contact the luggage service + lost and found department + Airfrance custimer service. Even though it was in the airplane the crew couldn't find it !!!! Which is weird.

So after the cancelation + after missing the connection flight due to the Airline mistake and layin directly on us + losing a lot of time in Paris + suffering a lot since we had with us an elderly man with health conditions  (Mr.Elias Hanna, reference L54I2P ) + not finding my backpack, I  am not qualified to a compensation Or/and even a refund for all these many troubles ?

Even in my Air France Application they notified me that we are qualified to compensation !

I have high hope that airfrance will do something for this manner since it is not fair at all plus it affects the reputation of airfrance very negatively....

Trash airline.","2024-01-11"
"2","Never again","Wow where to start.  First, not sure why they allow you to book a flight you can barely make a connection. Ours was a flight from Detroit USA to Athens Greece with a 1 ½ hour layover in CDG Paris France.  You realize this is barely possible when you land, and you see your next gate is three train stops away and you must exit and reenter customs and security lines to get back into the gate areas and then run though crowds and shops all the way to the end for the next gate. Forget trying to grab food or water or even using the restroom. Second, our flight into Greece the pilot missed the runway or something and had to pull up last minute and just says we must fly around again for 10 minutes to try that again. Super scary but OK we landed.  Then, on the way home from Paris back to Detroit, we are what seems to be a reasonable 2 1/2 hours early we asked and waited in area 5 for Air France for quite some time but was told by security we do not need this line and to head to security line past the pharmacy. After waiting a long time in that line, we were turned away and made to go back to check bags as they count both the backpack and carry on for the weight of 12 kilos maximum apparently. Our bags were not checked on the way in by the way and we see many bags that are way larger once we board the plane so are confused on who they check and why. So, then we go back to the check bag area, and they tell us it is now closed and that we should throw our bags away or rebook! What a joke, we came with these bags and were not asked any questions on the way to Greece. Then after asking for a manager, they say OK proceed to the business class areas and we can get your bags on. Another 30 minutes later we are forced to pay over 200euros even though I've already prepaid for bags and their credit card machine does not work so we need to run to the other check bag area 5 again and wait there as everyone is busy and will not help us.  The agent insists I still have time and makes us wait until they can find a credit card machine to pay the fee, we've already prepaid for they give us a tiny receipt with no information on it. Finally, we can make our way to the security line again after 2 hours we only now have 1/2 hour to make it to our gate. We are then waiting in long lines to scan our passport/boarding pass and then going through the x-rays my son is the only one forced to take off his shoes and we need to wait for a swab scan as I'm in line I get a text that our gate is now closing! We must take a train still and run through all the duty-free shops again my son now without his shoes on. By the grace of God, we made it to the gate, and they say OK we can get on but then they scan my son's passport and say, ""did you pay for his bag""!!! They ask where my receipt is and when I show it to them, they say, “this is all they gave you?” and wanted to charge us a third time for him to bring on a backpack???!!! I just don’t get it. This was by far the most disorganized and crazy airport crew and security I have ever experienced. I am just grateful to be home and safe with bags in hand. I will never ever fly with Air France again.","2024-01-11"

"1","Wanna feel like a sardine ?","Absolutely horrible. I have never been in such an uncomfortable seat even when flying with low-cost companies.

When the front seat was reclined, it was only 2 inches from my face ( and I am 6 feet tall and 156 lbs, so I am pretty slim ). 
Also, the internet connection I paid for did not work during the entire flight. The flight crew said that was the norm, not an exception. I got my money back three weeks after filing a petition.","2024-01-08"

I also had to 5 nights in hotels because of this which i didn't want or planned for which I had to pay for my self!! For several day they told me the bag will come this afternoon or tomorrow...

I was traveling with my family of 9 and AirFrance caused an immense amount of stress and anxiety our entire trip home. As we made our way to TSA, we were stopped to weigh our carry-on items. The staff informed us that both our carry on and our bag had to equal 12kg in total. The first time we went through we were told our items were over the limit so we stepped out of line and moved things around in order to meet the requirement. The second time we went through we were faced with one of the most non-compliant, arrogant, and rude staff member that I have ever encountered in an airport setting. After weighing our bags for a second time, one of our bags was over 12kg by 1kg. The staff member told us the we need to check in the bag. After insisting many times that we would take out some of our items which would cause our bags to meet the requirement since our flight was close to boarding, The staff member rudely refused and said that we must go check our bags in causing us to miss our flight. On top of that, our flight had a connecting stop in Seattle which we also didn’t make AND we already had 5 checked bags that left on the flight without us. This is outrageous and I am extremely upset by this situation. It is already hard as it is traveling with a big group like ours but when staff members also add complications to our travels, it gets out of control and ruins the whole experience. This is my second time traveling with AirFrance and both times I have been treated with disrespect and I would not recommend this airline to anyone. ","2024-01-08"
"1","NEVER FLY AIR FRANCE OR KLM","I am experiencing the most terrible flight experience. I booked a business flight from MDE-ZRH-MDE and Airfrance changed my flight without my permission. I had to overnight in Amsterdam on my return flight which is obviously not acceptable. The hotline said it is a KLM flight, however, KLM as well as Dnata disagreed. The call center just hang off… the so called super visor at the airport Zurich (Danilo) said that they can just rebook flights if the departure is within 24h. Then when finally somebody was able to rebook me they downgraded me to tourist class and now they want a supplement of 300 USD to book me again on business.","2024-01-07"

"1","WORST AIRLINE AND AIRPORT- AIR FRANCE","The service in first flight AF 475 was good, I had their shrimps for dinner and next day at Paris airport, I had bad loose motion the toilets were all so dirty and shabily maintained and the business lounge does not allow you there bcos my connection is next day. Every other airport I have experienced, they atleast let you stay anywhere in the airport gates or food court. Here I see no food court area, u go thru number of checking scanning of luggage, make u open suitcase even for travel pack small liquids toiletries. They tell me to come at 5.30 am to lounge. 
I luckily found one place with carpet, where I lay my shawl and slept on floor and cud sleep a bit on the floor. The airport hotel, some yono or something, when asked said 700plus usd per night.
I came thru first flight with assistance wheelchair, for second flight I did get any assistance. Which means people truly who can't walk, in a connection like mine wud be screwed.
So 6am , I go to lounge, now he says I don't have lounge access inspite of flying business. 10,000aud for business tickets is not good enough for them to provide 2 hours of lounge to just freshen up. I think it's ridiculous and such airlines and airports have made travel for people a whole miserable experience. Instead of pleasure trip. 
Hope to see such companies learn their lessons again sometime. 
Do not use air France,  is my recommendation. Having flashy shops is not good enough.
Even Indian domestic airports are better service, friendly staff and cleaner bathrooms. PARIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TOILETTE WERE MOST DIRTIEST I HAVE SEEN IN MY TRAVELS TO MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.

"4","Service has improved","Departure from CDG was delayed by nearly 1.5 hours due to a technical test at one of the engines, but arrival in Singapore was only 10 minutes late. I think their services have improved overall, starting with their lounge at terminal 2L. Food was very good at the lounge and during the flight, really nothing bad to say about it. They served real champagne in economy class. Headseats were available for all passengers in the seat pocket (for comparison, on the return flight KLM only provided headsets upon request and they were not enough for all passengers). The only thing I didn’t like is that cabin crew closed my window blinds when the sun started to rise above Iran, and I had to keep them closed for a few hours although I didn’t sleep. Long story short, this time Air France was much better than KLM.","2023-11-28"

I already saw myself spending the night in Paris, but the crew-lady (whose name I unfortunately no longer remember) helped me to move my seat to the front so that I could get off the plane as quickly as possible and arrive on time for my connecting flight to Frankfurt. 
Many thanks 🌹 also to the lady who immediately and without hesitation agreed to switch seat with me, because without her generosity I would not be able to get home on time.

We reserved and paid for tickets on the emergency exit so we would have more space because my boyfriend is 2.02mts and we spent almost half of the flight being bumped by people that wanted a drink or food because the flight attendants were resting/ being lazy..
At some point there were 17 passengers on the aisle trying to get food/drinks from one poor flight attendant left on his own..

"4","Aircraft changed twice resulting in several seat changes but otherwise at least no significant delay.","Originally scheduled to fly on a B787, this was changed several months before the flight to an A350-900 with the new business class suite seats which we were looking forward to trying.  However, 10 days before the flight the aircraft was changed again to an older A350-900 without the suite seats in business class.  Although the seats were comfortable enough, upon boarding we were moved to different seats as we were told a seat was broken in the row we had been allocated.  On this aircraft the even rows have the window seats near the window and the armrest by the aisle and the middle 2 seats are next to each other with the armrests on the aisle whereas the odd rows have the armrest by the window and the seat on the aisle and the middle seats have the armrests next to each other and the seats on the aisle.  This makes the odd rows seats less private than the even rows.  I was disappointed with all the changes in aircraft and the change of seats.  Other than that, however, the cabin crew were welcoming and attentive, the food and wine was very good and there was an adequate selection of entertainment.","2023-11-26"
"3","Not much room but nice extras","I flew from Paris to Sao Paulo the 23/11/2023, the flight was long and uncomfortable for me because I'm tall, so my legs barely had any room, it didn't help that the person in front of me went all the way back on his seat leaving me with even less room.

On the up side it was nice to have a free snack area to grab drinks and snacks , that made the flight more enjoyable, we also had a flight attendant called Jean, he was someone who obviously enjoyed his job, smalling and joking with everyone, trying to help as much as he cold, he 100% made the flight more enjoyable too, 100%  deserves recognition for his attitude.","2023-11-26"

He seemed to love working for Air France. He was very genuine and wished me my trip. Japanese language has many different ways in politeness which is hard even for Japanese people. It is very impressive. The other crew with him was nice too. Arigato, Livio. You made my day and my trip wonderful! Wishing you all the best!   ","2023-11-24"

"1","Non EU flyers get NO compensation","I always thought that an airline would treat all customers equally. Wrong!  If you live outside of the EU, Air France will NOT compensate you for a severly delayed or cancelled flight.

On September 22, just a few hours before boarding an Air France flight from Vancouver to Paris, I was informed by email that Air France had cancelled my second flight from Paris to Nairobi where I was supposed to begin a safari. My only option was to take a Kenya Air flight from Paris to Nairobi, 12 hours after I landed at Charles de Gaulle airport. 

Usually when you are forced to wait 12 hours because your airline cancels your flight, you are offered a minimum of 600 Euro compensation (this is even written on the Air France info site). But Air France refuses to compensate me, using the loophole of an obscure 2004 regulation that states that if the flight does not originate or end within the EU, they're off the hook. 

Really? First of all, my cancelled flight 814 originated in Paris, which, last time I looked, is smack-dab in the middle of the EU. Secondly, since when does an international airline that flies all over the world, compensate only those who fly witin the EU? 

The fact is: Air France has an obligation to treat all customers equally, and not give preferential treatment to customers who fly only within the EU. When I flew from Dublin to Vancouver last year, and the flight was delayed by 10 hours, Air Canada paid me compensation. 

Air France might consider this: why would any Canadian citizen, or anyone living outside the EU, choose to fly with Air France if they knew that they'd be treated like second class citizens, excluded from compensation packages that other passengers receive?

My suggestion: pick another airline!","2023-11-22"
"5","Great experience ","Sorry for the late review. My first time flying with Air France. I was skeptical bc of the reviews I read. This is my experience. September 24, 2023, AF 159, the whole crew was exceptional. It never gets easy for me flying, very anxious about it, can't even look outside the window. The flight attendant Silvie(not sure about the spelling) was amazing. She saw that my anxiety was high and stepped in right the way. She and all the crew made my journey bearable. I felt like a celebrity. And, they even communicated with my connected flight AF 1888 to Bucharest on September 24, 2023, and let them know about my anxiety. I couldn't believe it, as soon as I was seated a flight attended approached me and knew exactly what is going on with me. They also made ,all the crew, made my flight more comfortable for me.  Yes, I will recommend this airline and will fly again. Thank you.","2023-11-22"
"1","Bad service and dumb policies ","I flew to Europe on Delta for business and brought my usual luggage, which is an Osprey 34L backpack and an Osprey suitcase that is carry on size. Flew over no problem. Delta then transferred my return flight from CDG to Air France. Before entering security, they weighed both my my bags together, which came to a total of 17kg but 12kg was the limit (its 18kg if you fly business class but I was coach). I had to go back to the Air France check in to check my bag. There was no additional fee, but you could not keep your bags if you’re economy. And you guessed it, they lost my bag.

Through the WEB - as they say you can do it -  is impossible. Then I tried through whatsapp which was the only way to contact them somehow.
They made the change but I had to pay a slight difference. It was impossible to pay the difference. They said I have to call the country where I booked the flight. I did that and they send me twice a link that wouldn't work. Even they didn't know why i wouldn't work.  Calling the customer service in the country where I booked the flight four times (with some rude person attending) and then finally concluding that it's not possible to pay abd the only way is that I have to cancel again everything and make a new change..... it is still not resolved....

"1","Air France beyond awful","Missed our connecting flight to BKK due to flight delayed from LHR. Air France air crew was unbelievably rude. All the answers anxious passengers (connecting flights) get from them was 'I don't know' repeatedly in their French accent. No offer of making sure passengers with connecting flights to be allowed to disembark first. Qatar and Malaysian airline would have ensured passengers with connecting flight are informed all the way and every assistance provided to them based on our previous experience with these first class airlines. Qatar airways even had a airport buggy waiting at the gate to transport us to the connecting flight.
If air France crew isn't bad enough, Air France customer service is beyond awful. I am sure air France hire from Calcutta sector 5 to frustrate their customers from lodging complaints and seeking help.

 ","2023-09-21"
"1","AIRFRANCE NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE ","Our first issue started on arrival at Paris. We arrived on a connecting flight from Amsterdam (even though we paid a premium price to fly direct from Amsterdam to Hong Kong, but that is another story). On arrival, we went to pick up our 14 month old sons push chair, which we had been promised would be waiting for us in Paris, only to be told that it had been sent on to Hong Kong. This wouldn't have been too much trouble had it not been for the fact that we now had an 11 hour wait time to catch our flight to Hong Kong. We were sent from one department to the next only to be sent back and forth, absolutely ZERO empathy or assistance from almost all departments. The one exception being a very friendly young woman at the AirFrance Baggage counter, who went out of her way to find a rickety old buggy for us to borrow, as we killed time in Paris centre, which we were extremely grateful for, having just been treated so terribly be all the other AirFrance staff. We were then loaded on to our plane (which was absolutely roasting), only to be told that our flight had been delayed. So we sat in the plane, cooking alive, while they sorted out an issue with the cargo hold. Once the flight took off, the temperature got hotter, to the point where it was unbearable. I asked the flight staff why it was so hot, and if they could do something about it, which was met with blank expressions and no help whatsoever. Our baby boy was sweating so much, he couldn't get comfortable at all. For the entire flight, the only respite from the heat we got, was when the curtains separating business class and economy class were opened, which let in a cold blast of air. 
The food was disgusting. The pasta was dry, the bread rolls were so hard that they could be used to build a house out off or maybe used as a weapon. The flight attendants only seemed to care about the French speaking passengers and were arrogant and unhelpful to anyone else.
On arrival at Hong Kong, we went to collect our baggage, only to find out that our suitcase containing all of our clothes, toiletries and nappies for our baby ( which we had been promised in Paris, had already been loaded on to the plane for Hong Kong) had gone missing. So there we were in Hong Kong at 8pm, with just the very sweaty clothes on our back and a limited supply of nappies for our baby. On talking to the baggage desk in Hong Kong ( whom all were very friendly and helpful) we found out that the suitcase had not left Paris at all.
I couldn't be any more disappointed in a service, especially one that cost so much, yet failed to deliver on all aspects.
I strongly advise you to steer clear of traveling with AirFrance and be careful when your flight  changes through KLM, as this is why we were forced to fly with AirFrance anyway. We had no issues with KLM on our flight from Inverness to Amsterdam, but as soon as AirFrance got involved, the whole journey turned in to a nightmare.

"2","Inhospitable and Inconsiderate","I know this isn't Air France's fault, but let me start by saying that CDG is the worst airport I've ever been to. In the international terminal there is not a single restaurant to relax, sit down, have a drink and eat. There are two tiny ""healthy food"" spots with disgusting pre-made sandwiches that you warm up in a microwave (overpriced, of course). This is the international zone where people have 8 hour layovers. There's also no comfortable seating to sleep.

Now let's get into Air France. They changed our gate about 30 min before take-off and didn't make an announcement. We had to sprint to the new gate and almost missed our flight. When we asked the staff member why they didn't make an announcement, she shrugged her shoulders as though this was our problem. 

Then on the plane, the flight attendants harassed a poor mother beside us for the entire flight because her 4-year-old child was sleeping in his seat. They told her if he fell asleep, he had to be on her lap. He was only allowed to sit in his seat if he was awake. I've never seen anything like this - it was completely unbelievable and I felt so bad for the woman (this was an 8 hour flight and she had to keep a large child on her lap, despite having paid for an extra seat for him). So rude and inconsiderate. ","2023-09-17"
"1","Lost luggage and delayed flight on Air France ","We flew from Detroit, Michigan to Rome with a layover in Paris. After having booked this flight, our friends and relatives told us that Air France is notorious for delayed flights and losing luggage. The flight to Paris was ok, but once we arrived in Paris, we boarded the connecting flight to Rome, and we were stuck on the runway for over 1 hour. There was no apparent reason for this delay as the weather was nice. The plane's Captain also became frustrated, and announced over the loud speaker ""we are being held hostage by the French."" Once we arrived in Rome and waited for our luggage for over 2 hours, it was apparent it was lost. The representative for Air France kept assuring us that our luggage was there, and to just keep waiting. Finally the lazy representative agreed to check on the status of our luggage, and discovered it never left Detroit. The luggage was delivered us 3 days later, but we had to spend 3 days of our vacation time without it. We had to purchase new items at our expense. Once I got back to America after our 23 day vacation, I called Air France to file a complaint. A few weeks later they responded by saying I did not file the complaint within their 21 day time frame allowed, so my complaint was in valid. I was in Italy was no Internet or phone service to call or contact them. Their 21 day limit for a complaint is unfair. A large amount of travelers exceed 21 days on their trip. Please do NOT fly with Air France.! They will only cause you headaches and frustrations! I certainly will never fly with Air France again!!

"1","Don’t fly with Air France if you have a connecting flight","We travelled with Air France for our honeymoon from London to Madagascar via Paris. The flight and service was fine but on arrival at Madagascar we were told they had forgotten our luggage at Paris. They would not be able to get them across until the following night and we were booked on a tour around Madagascar leaving the morning after we arrived.

The team at the airport said they could not get our luggage across to us as we would be too far away by the time it arrived so we had to organise ourselves and pay to get it transferred (£300). Luckily this went to plan and we managed to enjoy the rest of the holiday.

Having spoken to others on the tour and the tour guide Air France appears to be a repeat offender for this. Two others had had their luggage lost before and the tour team report they regularly have someone who has their luggage lost and it is always Air France.

Having returned 21 days later I submitted a claim and was told because I hadn’t submitted this worthing 21 days of this incident (when we had minimal acres to internet and no access to a computer) they will not reimburse us.

Asking for reimbursement online was a hassle and not successful. I had all the receipts, but for some reason they couldn’t be transmitted using the AF website. The person who I was working with apologized because of the glitch on their part and asked me to resubmit a new reimbursement request, which I did, only to be told the window for the request had closed. At this point, I would have given a review of 1 star. Finally, I decided to write a letter with accompanying receipts to the CEO.

"1","Incompetent,  Traumatising, and Inhumane Customers Service","""It was a connecting flight from Helsinki to Milan, and I was pretty sure everything would go smoothly. My daughter and I landed in Terminal 2F. Each of us had a cabin-sized suitcase and a handbag weighing around 18 kilos each. An Air France check-in attendant at Vantaa Airport in Helsinki confirmed that it was alright for us to have them onboard. We passed through the security check and arrived at CDG on time.

However, when we reached the entrance to the gate, it turned out that we had to go through the security check again (!) and our cabin luggage was overweight, exceeding the limit of 12 kilos. The staff member at the entrance to the security check sent me to Section 5 of the Air France Customer Service to resolve the issue. My daughter stayed behind to wait for me at the security entrance.

What I encountered there was a display of incompetence and a total unwillingness to help from the so-called Customer Service. To be honest, any chatbot would have been more human and compassionate than the entire shift of that unsupportive and careless customer care team, which consisted of about 5 people in total.

First, they said I had to pay for extra luggage. Initially, I tried to argue that it was a connected flight within the same company. Then I agreed to pay, but they said the flight was closing. I asked them to provide me with the bill so I could pay through my Air France account immediately. However, the customer manager changed her mind while we were speaking. She said the only way to board the flight was to get rid of 5 kilos of luggage.

I rushed back to the security check, only to find out that they had allowed my 15-year-old daughter to pass through the security check with the same cabin luggage that was now considered overweight.

At that point, I started to feel very anxious. The staff member at the security check told me to go back to the customer management team. They asked for my passport, which was in my daughter's bag. I only had my boarding pass and showed them my Italian Residence Permit.

All my arguments, including the fact that I needed their help to retrieve my passport from my daughter after the security line where only they had access, and that it was their Air France double standard policy regarding luggage, fell on deaf ears. Two younger ground service attendants were looking as if they were watching a TV show episode, while the managers sneered at me, saying, 'What flight, madam? It's closed.'

Eventually, the flight was delayed for 90 minutes. I was about to throw away some of my textbooks (I'm a professor at Unimi), cosmetics, and shoes, but a beggar at CDG airport stopped me and said it was good stuff, so he should keep it. He took the items and walked away, considering it his lucky day.

Air France could have allowed checked baggage, and they could have provided assistance to both me and my daughter, who was trying to get help from the ground services near the gate. However, none of that happened, despite it being Air France's fault, and the Customer Support team didn't lift a finger to assist the passengers.

After reading other reviews here on TripAdvisor blaming Air France for incompetence, unprofessionalism, and even racism, I found them quite helpful, as I know from my traumatizing experience that such reviews are not unfounded.""","2023-07-11"

"1","Warning, Air France is not reliable","Cancellations and delays, non stop. Comedy of horror, except not funny. Too long to explain the 7or 8 changes. ","2023-07-07"
"5","Week to Paris","Disneyland Paris trip. Check-in was smooth and efficient. Transit through security at BHX took approx 20 mins so had time to eat before flight.
Flight was a little bit late leaving but not too bad compared to sum on the board. Cabin staff were very friendly and welcoming. Cabin was clean and seats were comfortable with ample leg room. Food and drink service was swift. Flight and landing were smooth. Movement through CDG was quick including immigration and bag check.
Overall would recommend Air France for any flight","2023-07-07"
"1","Air Farce, rather","Long-haul seats are tiny, I spent the flight with my shoulder tucked under the shoulder of a bigger guy in the next seat (and occasionally his under mine) which was very uncomfortable and, as you may imagine, rather awkward. They expanded their business cabin at the expense of economy class space. My return flight was cancelled and the alternative was departing a day in advance therefore wasting a day of the trip in the unatractive Bucharest airport, having to pay for meals and overnight accommodation. Air France refused to reimburse. Their Flying Blue program is also rather poor. All you get at Platinum level is access to the AF lounge which is now very crowded, if a little less so than the airport itself. Never free upgrades or an upgrades system like in the US. The available free refreshments are not worth the money you pay to fly long-haul in low-cost fashion in a cramped aircraft. The food on-board is often cold mashed potatoes with something that they call chicken or pasta or whatever. Cold mashed potatoes, man. Can you imagine THAT? To myself and my friends we refer to Air France as Air Farce (or worse) to at least get a laugh for the money we put into this farcical airline.","2023-07-05"
"5","Shout out to the ground flight  staff of Air France @SFO","Incredible experience after being bumped off Iberia who palmed us off to AF a day later after bumping us off, on a standby.

Thank you so much for your care and going above and beyond …much love and respect r and appreciation…..thank you!","2023-07-04"
"1","Emmett Louis Till type of experience","First time I'm having to do this but thought I must share my ""Emmett Louis Till-like experience"" on flight  AF1639 from Hannover Airport, Germany to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport because of course we are not in 1955! Lady serving coffee saw me wide awake but intentionally skipped asking if I wanted something to eat or drink like she just did everyone else around me. Of course I had to ask why she treated me differently. She eventually served my black coffee and water; angrily. I then walked up to her colleague and explained what had just happened and asked how I could leave feedback on my experience.

She eventually played victim as expected; a separate story made up too to cover up, obviously! Unfortunately, I do not get distracted or intimidated; all that mattered to me was to send my message accross directly, and I did. The message was clear and succinct, and no time was wasted on irrelevant made-up stuff.

Unfortunately, speaking up about racial inequalities/discrimination can be tricky because things like this get swept under the carpet and the majority suffer in silence. I believe people should treat each other equally. You do not become any more human when you discriminate. We could all just get on with our jobs/ lives without discrimination and contribute to making the world a better place for you and for me and the entire human race.","2023-07-03"

We paid extra money to go into the lounge and were told we can use it for our 11 hour lay over only to be denied entry with no refund. Flight delayed multiples times by hours and the food was trash.

"1","Terrible experience with Air France.","We were a group of 4 and purchased our airfares 4 months before our trip.  The day before our departure, we were unable to get our boarding passes online.  The agent could not help on the phone either. When we arrived in Montreal, Air France staffs could only assigned seats to us for the first leg of our journey, from Montreal to Paris.  She put us on STANDBY for the second leg which is from Paris to Florence, Italy.  When we arrived at the gate in Paris, the staffs told us right a way that the plane was full and we have to wait for the next flight which is 10 hours later.  We told them that we had purchased our tickets 4 months before and should not be on a STANDBY position.  There were a few passengers waiting for the seats.  If we had not stood our ground, the staffs would have given our seats to other standby passengers.  On our return flight home two weeks later, we were able to check in online the day before, but could not get boarding passes.  When we arrived at the Rome, Italy airport, there were long lineups at Air France counters for check ins.  No Kiosks.  The plane was delayed for almost an hour.  We missed our connecting flight from Paris to Montreal.  While rebooking our next flight which was 4 hours later, only two of us received assigned seats.  The other two were on STANDBY again.  The two without seats were instructed to get our seats at the gate counter.   My husband had to stand and wait for more than half an hour at the gate counter before we got our seats.  Thet fact the plane was not 100% full is mind boggling, why they waste their time and the passengers' and not assigned seats to all 4 of us in the first place. I can understand if someone purchases a ticket at last minute and the plane is full, a standby option is appropriate.  But we purchased our tickets many months before, it is fair that we should have the priority.  The way Air France conducts its business is not a sound one.  Air France ruins our perfect holiday.  We'll never fly with Air France again.  Final notes:  We lost 3 of our 4 luggages and they arrived 3 days later.","2023-07-01"
"1","Worst airline in the world","Very racist and uncooperative crew. They had the audacity to misbehave with my mother and deny her water even though she was asking for it so many times as she was unwell. I'm surprised that this airline is still operational.

Nightmare","Air France I traveled on the flight from London - Paris Wednesday 28/06/23 and you lost my luggage!! The Service staff at CDG are all new kids, still trained who don’t know jack 💩. A claim was done for my luggage, it was found to still be in London. Your delivery company Chronopost  was due to delivery my luggage at my final destination in Lyon. What happened? They LOST MY LUGGAGE!! What a great bunch on incompetents you both are! I had over £2500 of designer clothes, shoes, makeup, hair & skincare products, gifts for friends and not to forget the work tools as I am due next week in Germany for 3 days of conference for my 1 week at my new job! I’ve been anxious, crying and distraught for the last 3 days! How can this happen? London - Paris is 1h flight… how can you mess up something so simple. The worst part is that I’m a FlyingBlue member. Best believe, I want my things back, I’ve also gone to the police station to place a complaint and I want to be compensated for my emotional stress. I’ll never fly with Air France again.","2023-07-01"
"1","AIR FRANCE HEIST","If there is one word to describe Air France and its staff --- it is Obnoxious THIEVES! Air France will force you to pay to check in your hand carry!  Even as a couple you can only bring 12 kgs of hand carry! And they even include the weight of your handbags! For real! 

At the end of the day, this is simply a ploy by Air France to gain additional revenue. They leave you  on your own to print and put on your luggage tag on your check in baggages-- with no assistance from air france staff. Later on, they will stop you at security and force you to pay and check in your hand carry for being over weight - so they say. Since your check in luggages is already gone, you do not have the option to transfer some items. Now you are forced to pay for an additional chcek in luggage. 

The counter to check in your hand carry has a long line - manned by very few Air france employees. When we asked one of the supervisors if they could add personnel as we were running late, she Snootily and obnoxiously  told us to wait.  Hate this Airport! Hate this Arilines and its staff! The worst!!","2023-06-30"

"1","Dont risk it, its not worth it","I will never fly Air France again after the ordeal they put us through. They lost our luggage on the way to france and never returned one of our bags and then, after we had bought new luggage and clothes for the trip in Europe, they lost our luggage again on the way back. Lost on both sides of our reservation. We even interrupted our vacation in Barcelona to fly back to Charles de Gaulle for the day to retrieve our bags and they would only give us one and were entirely callous about the situation. Ive never been treated worse by a company. Also the food in business class was awful this trip (we have flown them before when it was good but this time it was horrid.) It is hard to know which is the worse problem, Charles de galls seeming criminal luggage theft ring operating with impunity or air Frances reaction to it and dereliction of their obligation to assist their customers.","2023-06-28"
"1","Never Air France again! Never! Never! Never!","May 2, 2023, Air France delayed boarding at least 8-10 times between 3:00 pm and 7:00 pm. About 7:00 pm AF moved us to a dark, unattended gate where we waited for about one half hour until we heard an announcement on the PA that the flight was cancelled and to go to Gate 14 to retrieve our luggage.  No explanation or apology and no contact with airline personnel. No information about later flights or any options.

When I die, if I am offered the choice of going to Heaven in first class on Air France or Hades crawling on broken glass , I would choose Hades.","2023-06-28"

When we landed in Paris, we were delayed on the ground for 30 mins because there was no one to let us off the plane .I had only over an hour approximately to make my connecting flight .When we disembarked the aircraft, we had a long walk to our gate, which wasn’t even our gate.We got stopped by airport staff who wouldn’t let us get on the shuttle bus to get to our gate .At this stage, I had roughly 10 minutes to make the flight .The airport staff assured us that the plane would wait for us which they didn’t.Eventually, I got the shuttle and had to run to the gate.When I got to the gate, the lady working for Air France was extremely rude and unapologetic.I had to be home for work which I explained to her and needed to get the flight.She was as mentioned very rude and explained there was nothing she could do and put me on the next flight which wasn’t until 10 pm that night.I was left waiting 9 hours at the airport .To add insult to injury, the flight I was meant to get at 10 was also delayed. Furthermore I emailed Air France regarding my concerns, to which they told me it was my fault I was late.I will not be flying with this company again.Very poor service.","2023-06-28"
"1","Air France is not “Bon” Voyage.","Air France is a terrible experience. If you’re thinking of booking with them… DON’T!  

The business class section is one of the most uncomfortably designed cabins and is very worn, a bit dirty (crumbs and paper in one of the storage areas) and old. They  managed to lose a large piece of luggage of mine and have not been able to provide any information as to where it could be or whether it made it in any flight.  The smaller piece that was checked in with the large one arrived… but no information whatsoever about the missing item.

The fact that one is kept in the dark about personal property shows the lack of customer care. Over 3 hours spent on the phone for naught. They say if they don’t find the item they lost for you  in 5 days , they will keep searching for another 30. That,  my friends,! is to be enough to keep you from fretting about all your property that is missing.  Nothing is updated on the link they give you and calling does nothing but get you a rep that knows nothing. They did this to my Co-worker’s  wife who was joining him in France to start a 2 week vacation.  Her nightmare ended with her finally getting the bag after 5 days… but  AF continued to lie about and mess up where he bag was as they really had no clue. 

They do not strive for customer satisfaction, so if you can find another flight to Paris, do yourself a favor. The AF for Air France stands for “Awful Flight”. Faites  Attention!.","2023-06-27"
"1","You couldn’t pay me to fly this airline again.","Terrible airline. Absolute mess trying to check in for flight as they seem to have no ability to understand that some people have green cards. The worst staff are in the airport. They just send you on a wild goose chase to get your bags checked, which is basically like a massive crowd hangin around a few self bag check things and then 1-2 people trying to manage all the chaos of people who can’t check themselves (like me), or have cancelled flights (seemed quite common based on the people I met on the plane). Then when you go through security they send the Brits and Americans down a separate line and some little man pulls out all the women and makes them weigh their bags and then go and pay €85 euros to check a bag if you’re even 1lb over. And by this I mean the exact same bags you can get through the airport security at seattle where there’s no little man from
Air France whose power has gone to his head that’s just basically trying to scam people into giving the airline extra money. They have no problem letting 300lb passengers through, but a 160lb passenger with  bags that weigh 1lb too much are doomed. That’s if you’re female though. There were plenty of men let through with a ton of heavy hand luggage. So basically, if you are a woman, don’t fly Air France.

On the plane it was delayed takeoff by 50 mins with no communication or explanation. I tried to go to the bathroom after 30 mins and got told off my a flight attendant. Then once we landed bags still had not arrived after 50 mins. And still zero explanation.","2023-06-27"

And extremely unprofessional. They forced me to check in my carry on luggage. They also forced me to pay extra $100 just because I am 2LB overweight in my carry on. When the tickets did not show what is the carry on weight limited . Non of the other airlines I have traveled with they ever weighted my carry on. I called customer service and they said “ you have to do your research prior to your trip “ the airplane from the old times. Food is horrible. If you want to travel drama and stress free . Avoid air france at all cost .","2023-05-22"
"2","Not Helpful","Could be a review for Charles de Gaulle as well as AirFrance, the whole experience was terrible.
Trying to check in as an English speaking person was almost impossible. We did have overweight luggage and understood we would have to pay extra but the process was terrible and slow. Could not pay for the extra weight luggage at the desk we were checked in at, had to go down further, a long way. 
Was advised the carry on luggage was OK, only to be sent back to checkin when trying to get through security.
Advised we had to check the carry on also and another cost.
We were running at this stage trying to get through the slowest security ever. We were on the deadline for checkin stressed out so much, then received a text message saying the flight has been delayed 1 hour.
Finally boarded and receiving a sandwhich last on the plane, the vegitarian option was the only option left. It was mashed olives and 1 sundried tomato. It was very unpleasent. 
Deplaning took a very long time also.
All in all, a very hard experience.","2023-05-21"
"1","COMPLAINT ON FLIGHT CANCELLED BY AIR FRANCE WITHOUT ANY INTIMATION","For many years, My family and I have been loyal customers of Air France, and not once have we experienced such bad service and rude behaviour from the team. Even though there are many cheaper and faster alternatives, We still choose Air France for the quality of service and hospitality offered. However, the turn of events this time will make us rethink multiple times before choosing this airline ever again. 

I had booked a round trip from Florence(FLR) to Chennai(MAA) on the 13th of May, 2023. On making the payment (Money had been debited from my account) and finishing the booking I received the following mail from the company. Upon ensuring all the above, any customer would hope their job is done in securing a ticket for their travel. In order to check a few details I logged into my account again on the 20th of May, 2023 and to my surprise found out my tickets are no longer visible.

I immediately tried calling every helpline I could and Air France Germany was the first to help out. They mentioned that there was a delay in the payment reaching the company, but they have received the payment and only my tickets are yet to be issued. Hence asked me to call Air France Italy and request them to issue my tickets. I also called up Air France India to confirm the same. By now I had also checked with my bank and they mentioned that the payment has been debited from my account but the airline is yet to claim it. 

I finally got hold of Air France Italy through WhatsApp and a call, only to find out my tickets have been cancelled without any notice. The lady who spoke to me even had the audacity to say, ""Please book your tickets with another airline if you do not like our service, we can not book you any tickets, you must do it yourself and we also can not guarantee the same prices.""  I have never dealt with such rude and pointless customer service staff. The WhatsApp conversation went as follows and that too was not solving any problem. 

The following are my questions to you :
1. Why was I not informed immediately if my payment was not received by you?
2. Why was I not informed about my booking being cancelled? 
3. Do customers have to plead with airlines to issue their tickets every time? I have never ever come across such a system. 
4. Why are different Offices of yours giving different information to the customer? Are you scamming us? 
5. Why was there no assistance from your end to help book an alternative flight? 

I am a student who was hoping to go home for a few days before I start work. Now that my money is trapped and your flight rates have gone ever higher I will not be able to see my family. It is a shame to see airlines as big and loved as yours treat customers like this. It would be great to see more empathic assistance and apology from your company in the future. I do not know if I will ever get a reply, but we students know how to take this to higher authorities and hope that this mail can act as a way to document my horrible experience with Air France.  The travel industry is responsible for connecting people across the globe and must know that there is so much at stake for travellers, a lot more than you can see. The least you can do is treat your customers right. Shame!

Another frustrated Air France customer","2023-05-21"

"1","Air France - Poor customer service - Go for KLM or another airline","I had used up all my savings to buy my parents tickets to come see me in Colombia.  I got my tickets on Kayak with Air France and KLM, as it was the most affordable as well as conveniet flight on the net in January this year.

A month later Air France cancelled my original flights and I was forced to change flights as I had arranged other flights as per the Air France dates to take my parents around Colombia. 

My initial ticket had only one single layover,  and after that forced change, I ended up having a ticket with three layovers each way as Air France had cancelled my original flights, which were supposed to take only one stop once again. 

I am saying that I was forced to accept the change as I had no other money to spend on new tickets with another airline as I had already spent all my money on Air France and they take up to 60 work days to return your money. And it was impossible to miss the rest of my flights as I had bought them as per the Air France tickets which were bought first. 

Customer Service and management staff ignored my reasons and claims altogether. They would speak back rudely on the phone and at the airport in France.

We didn't have any boarding passes or whatsoever as the app wouldn't issue them. 

 There was no kiosk or a service desk to help us get a boarding pass so an airport member had to make an exception to let us in with the e-ticket and look for help. 

Partnerting airlines on our reservation were ITA and Tarom which were absolutely dirty and unpleasant. Tarom's plane felt like a tractor and filthy. 

The reservation says that meals are included and partnering airlines seem to skip or ignore that bit as we didn't get all meals that had been included. 

 They seem to be turning a blind eye on you. 95 per cent of customer service agents are grumpy and impolite. First and last time on Air France. Please, avoid it.","2023-05-20"
"1","If you are a POC, consider a different airline.","My family and I had a wonderful trip in Italy and had to catch an early flight via Airfrance to Paris and then catch our connecting flight back home to the U.S. I am a black woman traveling with my white boyfriend and my black younger brother. We were treated differently from every other passenger on the flight. The reception from the flight attendants was very cold and harsh. But worst of all was towards the end of the flight when the attendant SCREAMED (not an exaggeration, but indisputable fact) at my brother to turn his phone off before landing. He had fallen asleep on the ride with his phone in his lap and upon landing had missed the announcement to turn off his phone. Other passengers had made the same mistake and I watched the attendant politely ask passengers to power off their phones in a kind, even voice. But the moment the attendant noticed my brother's phone in his lap she actually SCREAMED at him to turn it off, multiple times. She continued to repeat herself at the same aggressive volume while jabbing her finger at the air towards him as he calmly complied without any protest. He even apologized about not hearing the announcement! She then asked him if he was even capable of turning off his phone thus insinuating that he wasn't smart enough to do so. My brother is very intelligent and very mild mannered. He was absolutely horrified/embarrassed about the interaction. She was so loud that it caused other passengers to turn in their seats to stare. The way she was screaming at him, you would think our row had committed a crime. It was incredibly belittling, utterly horrific, and beyond inappropriate. I will never fly with this airline again and I will advise all of my other friends/family/acquaintances to never ride with Airfrance or support this business. I'm not typically a person that will complain or write reviews, but I felt haunted after the experience because it was so ugly and so unreasonably aggressive. How disgusting.

"1","Problems encountered during my trip on flight AF655 on Friday, April 14th from Dubai to Pari","Due to the health issues of the captain (thankfully, I heard he's doing better now), we had to make an emergency landing in Vienna, where we were disembarked by bus at Terminal 3 around 4 a.m. Upon arriving at the terminal (there was no Air France representative to welcome us or keep us informed), an airport employee told us to go to the Air France counter at Terminal 1.

At the Air France counter, the hostess told us to go back to Terminal 3, where an Air France hostess would assist us. So we returned to Terminal 3 (after spending over an hour queuing at security) only to once again find no Air France representative.

I called Air France customer service multiple times, asking to be transferred to another flight (there were over 6 Vienna-Paris flights in the morning, including 3 Air France flights with available seats, as I checked on the internet). After being told that a seat was being reserved for me on the 10:05 a.m. flight, I was later informed that it was no longer possible but that I would be called back. However, I never received a call back, and despite my reminders, no solution or alternative was ever offered to me, nor was I kept informed.

I spent over 10 hours in Terminal 3 during which time I was never contacted or met with an Air France representative, and most importantly, I was never kept informed about the progress in resolving the issue (which prevented me from making alternative arrangements). Five days later, I received a generic letter from Air France with vague apologies, congratulating themselves for doing their best to resolve the problem and minimize its impact on passengers. It is a shame, and I recommend Emirates, which has a daytime flight, avoiding the need to spend a night on the plane, and, above all, treats its customers well.","2023-05-17"

"1","Is there a zero star review rating?","I always air travel by economy class. The food on Air France by far was worse of the worse. They lost my luggage, and it was found damaged 2 days later.  The air conditioning in the plane has no individual control vent/fan level - it was hot as hell for an 11-hour flight. We (over 100 people) were waiting in line for over 30 minutes to drop off the luggage. Two groups of people just cut right in front of the line, and the ground agents just let them despite all the protests.  This is my first time with Air France and definitely is the last time.","2023-05-14"
"1","Worst experience ever","I had booked a flight from Winnipeg - Toronto - Paris - Bangalore on May 4th. Somehow I missed my connecting flight from Toronto. I ran to the Air France counter and there was no one. I asked a few friends of mine as well as I called Air France canada to check where my luggage was, and we were informed that the luggage was on the flight for final destination.

.There was no flight in the next few days and I had to get to india as there was a family emergency. So I ended up booking the next air India flight and got to Bangalore. When checked with the Air France staff in Bangalore, they did not have my luggage and denied to create a report as I was a no show on the flight and the luggage must have been off boarded in Toronto.

It has been a s**tshow since then. both Air France canada and Bangalore were not even taking the responsibility of the luggage, did not even raise a complaint even though I reached out them almost every day. Finally I was able to convince a friend of mine to go to the air port and talk to the Air France guys. He was allowed to go to the baggage arrival area and he found all four of my bags there. The Air France staff mentioned that they are not going to take the responsibility for the luggage and would probably be thrown somewhere in the lost and found. They offered him to take the luggage home if he wanted as the luggage was not safe there and they won’t care for securing it. The manager on duty mentioned that if their was a request raised, he could have helped until then he can’t do anything.

I escalated the issue though my travel agent company (Flight hub). I believe they pushed on the issue and Air France finally raised a report for me. Guess what, I called Air France to ask them if my friend can drop the luggage to the airport, it still has all the tags on. Previously the agent started to say that the duty manager had asked my friend to keep the luggage and once a ticket is raised we will see what can be done. Later once the ticket was raised, the agent on call says, it’s has already been 7 days, so we can not act on the request anymore. I was startled, I have been calling Air France canada and Bangalore location everyday to request for the last 1 week to raise an incident and they did not, they kept pushing me towards one another and the agent from Air France canada says that we had the ability to create a report for you, you must not have asked for it. I know it sounds ridiculous that I begged them to help me out to locate my luggage, stayed on calls with them 2-3 hours almost everyday and then they pin all on me at the end that I failed to ask to create a report. And now I have to post about $3000 to get my stuff couriered to me. It’s just so ridiculous. I would not recommend Air France to anyone, worst customer experience ever with an Airline Company.","2023-05-13"

They did not care, they provided wrong information, and just called next in the row.
Now I have a damaged luggage which I do not know who will repair.
And AF's web page does not allow to file two complaints from the same flight, one for the luggage and another one for no customer service. ""page error"" message is their way to reduce the amount of complaints. And there is no option to report poor service at the arrival airport.","2023-03-13"

After taking 4 months to process my request, they sent a refund for just for half of the payment you received, with no effective reason. 
I was not given any other possibility than the refund request, but they didn't even provide a voucher for the remaining part. I will probably proceed with legal actions to enforce the refund.
I gave 1/5 but it should be 0/5.","2023-03-13"
"1","Never using Air France again. You couldn't make it up!!","Air France failed to advise us in advance that service could be affected by a strike in France, if they had we could have changed to a direct flight. So we flew to Paris, the flight was late, we missed our connection to Rome. Their solution was to transfer us to KLM and fly us from Paris to Rome VIA AMSTERDAM??!! When the flight to Amsterdam was also delayed by the strike and we knew we would miss the connection to Rome they refused to have any more to do with us, saying it was now KLM (their partner airline) who would deal with us and give us overnight accommodation in Amsterdam.  They told us if we wanted to stay in Paris and get a flight from there to Rome the next morning they would not pay for it. Many upset and angry passengers at the desk and four ""customer service reps"" hiding in the office at the back having a chat, leaving two overworked staff to deal with it. The agent we eventually saw admitted that we'd be better off leaving France as the strike was expected to continue the next day.  The only useful communication we got from them. So we went to Amsterdam, and eventually got to Rome after 28 hours of travel. Bad enough, but on the way back 3 days later (no strike now) the same thing happened, the flight was 45 minutes late leaving Rome and we were advised to ""run through the terminal"" and we might catch the connecting flight home. Guess what? The connecting flight was actually on time, and despite getting to the gate 10 minutes before, they refused to let me on. I was at least given accommodation in a CDG airport hotel, but finding your way out of the terminal is a nightmare, inadequate signage, nobody around to help, I eventually found 4 red jacketed ""helpers"" standing in the station having a chat and the helped me find the shuttle. The only pleasant experience of the day was the kind guy behind the Ibis check in desk, but guess what? He was English! I have never in my life had a worse experience, and I fly a lot.","2023-03-13"
"2","Old airplanes / uncomfortable business class","From where to start with this mess called Air France? 
Business class seats have the same distance with economy class. All 4 flights delayed. I lost both times connections due to delays. 
Not clean cabin. 
The crew was very polite but had no clue or did not want to deal with the passengers who lost their connection.

Just a really bad experience on everything. 

I strongly suggest to avoid this airline.","2023-03-12"
"1","Air France lost my belongings and their remboursement policy is just a joke","AirFrance has lost my baggage and didn't provide me the slightest support when I called the earth team at Charles de Gaulle airport. Moreover they corresponded me a compensation which, not only is ridiculously inferior to the real amount I have lost, but that I will also never receive as they transferred the money to the WRONG BANK ACCOUNT. I believe that AirFrance reimbursement policy is only a fassade and I consider myself absolutely dissatisfied with this treatment as:
 
- AIR France only accepts paper receipts as proof of payment, no card movements or bank statements are accepted.  I would like to know why in 2023 are bank statements not an acceptable proof of payment, given that they include my full name and my card number they are q more solid proves of my personal purchases compared to a nameless receipt. Anyways, if this is the rule you should the victims know from the beginning. Failing to do so, naturally, jeopardizes their capacity of receiving their due compensation.

- they asked me to provide paper receipts three/four months after my baggage was lost. How do you expect people to keep paper receipts of any kind of item for months after they were bought? 

- air France transferred the forfeit reimbursement to the wrong bank account, as they didn't check my bank details first. 

I strongly suggest to avoid this irresponsible air company.","2023-03-12"
"1","Just another horrible airline","Why does flying have to be barbaric! We booked premium economy months in advance. Air France change our flight twice during that time, which resulted in our return flight changing from 4PM to 6AM. 

And despite that my husband and I had assigned seats with our class of ticket, when we ""checked -in"" for our flight we found we had been moved and were rows away from each other, and the only available seats were other singles scattered throughout the plane.

Flying sucks!","2023-03-12"

Overall id rate them a 0/10 however that wasnt an option on here, theres been zero transparency, the worst customer service and they definitely should not be acting like they will be able to fly when they blatantly arent going to.","2023-03-09"
"5","Quick and Easy","This was just a short hop from Paris to Manchester but came at the end of a very long haul journey. To that end, it was important it went quickly and smoothly and it certainly did.

"5","Super Service","We were lucky enough to be in business class for this long haul flight and it was excellent. The staff were the people who made it as they were fun but very professional and looked after us superbly.

The entertainment system was excellent with great noise cancelling headphones and a very good selection of films.

 The two meals we had on the flight were both superb and served with excellent wines and accompaniments. This was a 13 hour flight, but it didn’t feel it is the level of comfort and service was just top class.","2023-03-09"
"1","The Worst Airline EVER","On Wednesday 2/22/23, my boyfriend and I were scheduled to travel back to the US from Paris, France. Due to the lack of help, direction, understanding, and competence of the Air France employees, we missed our flight home. 

Upon arrival there was a lack of communication regarding where to check in and what we had to do for the tax refund. The check-in and the refund process took longer than expected due to lack of direction from airport employees. When we finally arrived at the TSA line I asked the TSA employee if we would make our flight due to the time. We were told by 3 TSA workers we would make our flight, and they refused to move us ahead of the line. 

Once it was my turn to walk through the scanner, my bag was pulled for further search. The elderly woman ahead of me had an issue and made a scene because she was going to miss her flight. 

Instead of continuing with TSA searches most of the TSA workers stopped working to tend to the elderly woman. In the middle of this drama I told a TSA male worker I had to go or I'd miss my flight. He aggressively told me it was not his problem and I have to wait. All of the workers refused to acknowledge my concerns and ignored me.  

My boyfriend went ahead of me to the gate to explain the situation to the Air France boarding team. A black male worker (unsure if he was management) rudely dismissed my boyfriend when he tried to explain the situation.  My boyfriend proceeded to show him on Facetime what was going on at the TSA search. The Air France workers were now fully aware of the situation.  By the time I arrived at the gate, they closed the doors and refused to let us on the plane. 

We asked why they didn't say from the beginning we wouldn't be let on? We also question why they were so aggressive and mean to us. At this point the workers became aggressive. My boyfriend approached the black male worker to ask his name for this report. He refused to provide his name and told my boyfriend, ""don't worry about my name, I have your information"". The manager on duty proceeded to get in my face, point his finger and yelled telling me to shut up, to behave and not act like an American, and then threaten to call the cops. 

They then refused to help us at the gate with ticketing. We were sent to 5 different locations throughout CDG to try to get our flight rebooked. Every ticketing booth gave a new reason as to why they could not assist us. 

My boyfriend ended up calling Delta directly, which is the ONLY reason we had a flight for the following day. 

We had to pay for the flight change and hotel. I also had to use my last sick day at work due to this inconvenience.

We flew home business class which was FILTHY! Considering the amount of viruses and the amount of money spent to travel in business class; I was shocked at the amount of dirt and filth on our seats. I have pictures and video of the seats and dirt I cleaned off.

Jointly and separately my boyfriend and I travel often around the world and throughout the USA; we've never been treated this way, let alone threatened by people who are supposed to make travel safe.

This is my first time doing this type of report. I feel strongly about this and believe the air travel department should know Americans are not welcomed or treated well in Paris; more specifically CDG airport. 

I would like this entire situation investigated. I have an image of the manager who threatened us. I’m sure the airport has cameras to validate my story. 

I would also like a refund considering the conditions of the plane and how we were treated.

I am open to conversation and can provide all evidence via email or hard evidence via mail.","2023-03-07"

I was pleasantly surprised with all 4 journeys with AF during our trip to Cuba. The 777 was fairly new, clean, tidy and as comfortable as can be in economy - I'm 6ft 2 inches tall and had enough room in my seat.
On board entertainment was good with a decent range of new and more recent / popular films & TV shows.
The staff were very helpfull & pretty happy, as opposed to some of the reviews I read and the food service quick & efficient.

"5","Air France  Stands above the Rest -!!","Superior Experience

My review on my first Air France flight, from Madrid to Paris! 

I have flown millions of miles in first class, premium class and coach, and have achieved Ambassador level status at major hotel chains, and while I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing excellent service, AirFrance stands out above and beyond all of my travel experiences!

From booking, through the most amazing check in experience, to the people and airplane, 100 out of 10 experience !!! WOW WOW WOW! 

Superior Flight Check In: The check in process and web design are both flawless, intuitive, easy and fast! It’s so good, I never want to fly another airline again! 

Superior Team: I believe the gate agents and flight attendants deserve to be titled Humble Airline Executives. They are professional, wildly competent and intelligent, and exude both leadership confidence and humbleness simultaneously. They are truly a level above any team I’ve experienced in over 30 years of travel.  

Superior Plane: the isle is wide enough to pass effortlessly with a carry on behind you, the seats are comfortable and the plane feels modern and fresh! 

I don’t know what more anyone could ask for on a flight !

I LOVE AIR FRANCE and highly recommend the experience to all.

Sincerely, and with all my respect and appreciation, Donna","2023-03-05"
"1","Disappointing","Haven’t had time to make a proper complaint but here I am . I am extremely disappointed with Air France , very unhappy with this all situation , I’ve felt neglected since my luggage disappeared, Air France you demonstrated that you don’t care about your customer at least not me , I haven’t been contacted by Air France not even once . I am the one contacting you since day 1 , staff show no care in the world to solve the problem , very unhappy with customer service , poor engagement , I’ve called several times and all your staff could say to me and show is that they don’t care and they can’t do anything same number but different information as well , each person give me different opposite updates about whereas my luggage was as well , staff need some training and please do better it’s disappointing a company like yours have this type of service . 

I had the unfortunate incident of not putting a AirTag on my luggage but never thought this would happen , had to spend a fortune on clothes and products that were also meant for leisure because of your negligence with my luggage . I’m not feeling that you’re dealing with this case properly as well . Have made a claim a few days ago and you guys also take so long to answer ? Ugh ….","2023-03-04"

"1","Missing Bag, costumer service and airport services.","We flew from Geneva to Miami with a connecting flight in CDG Paris. 

We flew on Sunday the 26th of February. Before landing in Miami, we were informed our bags were delayed. 

An employee from AirFrance was waiting for us to take our info and provide the claim number. He stated that the bags were located and were going to arrive next day. 

The following day, we received 2 bags out of 3. As logical we contacted AirFrance as soon as possible through all possible channels to inform them we were still missing a bag. To be sure we decided to pass by the airport, to make sure they were informed, it looked like they didn’t. 

Next day, we called again same response no news as where the bag was. As a result, we decided to pass by the airport again. We spoke we the same employee that received us when we landed and incredibly he didn’t even know that we where missing a bag (he is the guy in charge apparently for missing bags). Even though we called and went to the airport. His response was that we were doing everything wrong, that the costumer service for missing bags is not for that.. 

Yesterday we called again to both “departments” costumer service for missing bags, which is the one AirFrance provides on the website and to the Miami International Airport AirFrance Staff. And they Still don’t know where the bag is. 

I don’t recommend anyone to flight on AirFrance! Avoid this airlines because the customer service is there for nothing, it doesn’t exist!!","2023-03-02"

We had to pay for the extra flight with the understanding that it would be refunded.  This occurred September 2022.  From then until now we have been approved for the refund but the airline has not sent us the money.  All banking information we send is rejected; they will not send a check; they will not refund to the credit card on which the was charged.  Not only that but if we send a separate inquiry we are told the claim is being handled by a separate agent and then the sign the same name as the other agent already involved!","2023-02-28"
"4","A  pleasant experience overall!","We flew from London Heathrow to Osaka via Paris and back in December.  It was an enjoyable experience from start to finish (a little hectic at CDG Airport re wheel chair access and transfer to terminal).

Quick check-in and relaxing break in the lounges available.

On time departure.  Return journey was four hours longer due to Russian airspace issues and we had to fly from Japan via Canada, Alaska, Greenland!  However, we were well looked after by the crew.

Delicious French food and drinks served on all flights.  Champagne before take off. Snacks and drinks available on request during the flights.  Hot chocolate requested was absolutely divine!

Comfortable seating / bed made for a stress free journey.  Coats stored in the cabin hold.  Good quality entertainment.  Wi fi available. Very clean all round.

Outstanding cabin crew on all flights.  Multilingual.  Professional but friendly service.  Our thanks to all.

On our return flight one of our cases was not loaded on the plane at Paris airport.  As soon as we landed in London we received a text informing us of this and we were kept in regular touch as to the whereabouts of the case which was delivered 3 days later.  Slight inconvenience was caused but we appreciated being informed on time.

After paying over £2000 for a long haul flight claimed we weren't guaranteed hang luggage, even though they had let others on with massive bags. When we tried to ask why, we were told to move so they could deal with other waiting passengers! This was the least of the infringements but definitely the icing on a rather shut cake.","2023-01-06"

Negative outcomes of the situation:
- High levels of stress, resulting in a visit to the Medical centre for 3 hours (almost losing my rescheduled flight on Christmas eve)
- Use of credit card for unexpected expenses at the airport
- Family reunion was lost (the purpose of my trip)

Positive aspects of the experience
- The airline was able to reschedule my flight, and I was offered a bed and breakfast.

"1","Take NO repressibility for their mistakes and the inconvenience and loss they cause.","I flew with them in the summer. My luggage was lost for 4 days. ON arrival their agent told me it will arrive that evening, and I can buy whatever I need, and after I asked, he said I can then file a claim when I arrive back to London. 
The luggage did not arrive for another 3 days.
When I got home I made a small claim for few items I bought, which was rejected because they relied on terms and conditions I did not read, that require filing within 21 days. But since my holiday after 3 years of covid was for 28 days, they simply declined. Relying on clauses that let them off. The claim was for about 5% of the purchase price of flying tickets. If they are as petty on such small claims and from business class, I would argue they will do anything to avoid liability, rather than care.
One more point. We had a connection flight with them. My suitcase also didn't arrive with us on the way back. But this time the delay was only 24-48 hrs, and there was no issue of compensation as it was a flight home. But really think twice before you book them with a connection.","2023-01-03"

Im a Brit that usually pays a premium to travel non-western airlines such as Singapore Airlines (SIA).  But took AF for this very long family trip.  So impressed with the service and catering. It is now so much better than SIA (which partly also reflects SIA cost cutting since COVID).  AF film selection a tad too limited for non-french speakers compared to some other airlines but the service, pilot communication and economy class food were all excellent and hopefully a sign of a new, era for the airline.","2023-01-02"
"1","2 000 Euros for a lost/ stolen bagge","So, I paid 2 000 euros to fly from Basel Mulhouse to Paris, then Paris to Singapore and Singapore to Brisbane. I've decided to go before the Christmas season because AirFrance had planned to go on strike and I was meant to start work early January so I didn't want to miss my work opportunity. I modified my flight ticket, took my three flights and saw no luggage.
It's been 15 days now, and I've been trying to contact AirFrance through every way, but nobody is replying to me. They ignore me on Whatsapp, don't reply to email. They are not taking responsibility for it and want me to contact Qantas because this was my last flight. However, my baggage was last seen in Paris Charles de Gaulle. So, I believe one of their employee simply stole it as it vanished.
I also need to add Allianz insurance hasn't replied to me and their online form didn't work. So, it's been 15 days, I've had no financial help and no replies from anyone.
I've used AirFrance only  three times in my life and every single time, I've had an issue. Flight cancelled, flight date modified, luggage lost. You don't get an apology, the customer service is inexistant.
2 000 EUROS LOST. Christmas not spent with my family due to your strike and no apology. I will never use AirFrance AGAIN.","2023-01-02"

I then saw that most of the other passengers had much bigger bags than me. I was very confused by it and felt that I was discriminated against. This feeling of being unfairly treated makes m assured that I will never take this airline again.

I explained that I was catching another flight when I arrived in Mumbai and would not have enough time to go to pick up my bag and then catch the flight. He did not care at all. Once I saw that most of the people had larger cartons than mine I felt like it was personal.","2022-12-31"

We filed a claim but we haven't received our bag. Than later we found that it's not only me but thousands of people lost their bags. They are still loosing people's bag. It seems there is no authority to punish them hence they are taking this granted. When we call customer service and ask for help, we get very rude response and when we tell them that we report it to US DOT they proudly say that yes we can go ahead and report to US DOT. We understand that AF was not prepared for summer rush but what about now. They are still loosing people's bag which means something is wrong with their operation. They are purposefully doing this. so I would like to know customer that be aware of this Airline.","2022-12-28"

"1","I wish I'd known before flying with Air France","For anyone planning to travel with Air France please be aware that they have the worst reputation in the world for lost luggage - several FB groups and chat forums with thousands of followers all reporting terrible experiences.
My own luggage is still missing after two months and a comedy of errors by AF in mis-recording my name, my flights, delivering the wrong bag and closing my report etc. too long and boring s story to tell in full.

I travel frequently and have never had such a poor experience with any other airline.  

On the upside, their business class seats are comfortable.  

Nothing however will tempt me to fly with them again.... poor KLM, their partner airline will get tainted with the same brush, probably unfairly.","2022-12-26"
"1","Luggage lost and no answers","My luggage was lost and Air France says this is not their responsibility as they have a third party to do the baggage handling service.

However, on the 8 hour flight from Paris to Miami, Air France FORGOT to provide a gluten free meal. 

If I have gluten, I pass out. So I enjoyed nuts and juices for the 8-hour flight. 
When I contacted Air France, they told me that they were sorry. No compensation for their error.

The moral of the story--if you need a gluten-free meal in business class, take your meal on board with you!","2022-11-07"
"1","Air France business class lounge in Zanzibar is non-existent!","Air France in Zanzibar is a fraud. The airline does not have a contract for its passengers to use the Business Class lounge so even IF you have paid for a business class ticket, to use the lounge in Zanzibar airport, you will be told to pay USD $30. 

Air France knows that their business class passengers will not be able to use the lounge and they make sure NOT to advise passengers. You will make the discovery when you attempt to enter the lounge.

When I contacted Air France for a refund, they told me that they are not responsible for business lounges outside of France! 

That’s called collecting money under false pretenses! And getting away with it! Shame on you Air France!","2022-11-07"

We had a 10 day baggage delay. Despite our efforts to ensure our hotel addresses and duration of stay are updated, requsting them to call us piror to delivering them. Air France send them to Nice when we left 7 days earlier, only to have them routed back to CDG.

AF customer hotline is worst than a placebo, they offer you nothing other than frustrating you and making you feel helpless and despair. They cannot bring urgency to anyone, they cannot reach out to anyone else in Air France, they can, however update notes to your claim, which doesnt seemed to help at all. 

Now back home, I have submitted the baggage delay claim to Air France and the process of claiming felt all so familar. 2 weeks has passed, no one has looked at it. This customer hotline here operates from 930am to 11am and 1pm to 2.30pm and I count myself lucky I spoke to someone. Again, the customer service doesnt know when the case will be processed, there is no expected turn around time, and I was told there are too many claims currently.  

All good if nothing happens when you fly Air France, however, when something happens, you wished you read this post! and I certaintly wished I read other traveler's post before booking AF.","2022-11-05"

Our Delta Flight to Amsterdam was canelled so the Delta team rebooked us from Edinburgh to Paris then Paris JFK on Air France at 10.30 on 25th October 2022. We were so relieved to see the space, quality, full comfort headphones that slotted into a neat space between the seats. There was  an adjustable foot rest and  padded blanket. We were handed eye masks and ear plugs etc in a lovely Air France colour reusable zip bag/cosmetic bag. The food was exellent from snacks to main course and the man looking after us was polite, patient, attentive and charming.  We could not believe our luck. We had to take Delta comfort + home and while it was okay it was not a patch on Air France and the airplane that we were on.

I had 2 cases of refunds with Air France. First one happened because of war in Ukraine and i needed to fight 4 months to finally get my refund.

Second case happened recently. I bought a ticket and in 20 minutes it was cancelled by Air France but regardless of that i was charged. I made refund request almost one month ago and until now i don't have any information about when it will be completed. I tryied to call to local country support and they sent me to sales department, then the sales department sent me back to the local support with any updates about my request. Social media support pages ignoring my issue and only send me repetitive useless answers. All my claims where closed without solving my problem and even without notifying me.

Until now i don't know when i can get my money back and for this time because of currencies rate change i am going to lose about 10% of the ticket price.
All of this looks like a fraud to me. I don't think i will use Air France again.","2022-11-02"
"1","a hell on air","I originally bought my ticket with KLM because i always had a good experience with them  but they booked me on air-france. It was a hell. I had to reschedule my inbound fly and I paid as much as I paid for my ticket in first place. Then, I was looking and calling them to get my invoice to pass to my company and it was a mess because i was told many stories how to get my invoice...none of them worked...they had incompetent people working in costumer service (CS) who had no idea how to get those things and I even would say their  CS is a joke. 
During the fly... I had a baby crying all night long and kicking my seat: inbound-outbound. They should create a special section for those kind of families. Service was awful as well...i asked gluten free meal...it never came! i did not care about it because that meal is whatever. if you plan to go to Europe...fly with swiss or KLM airlines.

"1","Air france, bank transfer and poor customer service","I have paid for our upcoming flights via bank transfer as instructed 26 days ago in full. I logged onto my booking to update passport details and it says my booking has been cancelled. I ring air france multiple times to discuss and emailed 3 times with all reference numbers and confirmation numbers to show proof of payment. They tell me the booking hasn't been paid. I ask to speak to a manager, each time being told to ring back in an hour as they're busy. I can't file a complaint yet as it'll require me to cancel my booking. Just going round in circles. Tried to ring to pay again and will request a recall of the initial payment (as advised by one of the staff) but now being told I can't pay the initial fee as my booking was cancelled (which another advisor told me I'd pay that price). Even though when I give the booking reference it pulls up all passengers details from the original booking. So frustrating as such a simple problem to fix. Going round in circles not being listened to by' customer service' and we're supposed to fly in less than a week and still non the wiser as to whether we have a flight? Where my money is? Or am I going to have to rebook for twice the price for a fault that is not my own?

Our premium seats did nit decline. In researching this, I learned that this has been the case for over 10 years. The steward said he understood, apologized and said all passengers in these seats complain.  Air France has done nothing to address these seats only charge more for them than Delta Comfort. We could not sleep for the 8 hour flight but when I used the restroom, all the Delta Comfort passengers behind us were fast asleep. AF should be ashamed.  We will never fly AF again overseas or in Europe. They don’t deserve our business or money.","2022-10-30"
"1","Created an account to share my horror story","I don't leave reviews. It's not my thing. But I have to put this out online because Air France think they are above the law and above the minimum of customer service required. 

After cancelling two flights back to back we had to stay an additional night in Washington DC, booking a last minute hotel room at our cost. 

We arrived late to Paris by 2 days, missing our luggage so had to buy a bunch of toiletries etc. 

3 months on after chasing them multiple times I have given up trying to get my money back. The online agents direct you to the phone lines, the phone lines have you wait for 2 hours then drop off. 

If you get through to someone they direct you to the online claim form (mine has sat unreviewed for 3 months). 

They can't even do their legal minimum to reimburse me - how could I trust them to do the legal minimum maintainance on their aircraft or staff training.

Will no be flying Air France or KLM again. Shameful airline.","2022-10-30"

All the four flights I took from blr to paris and paris to casablanca and the two returns flights through the same route were delayed. I choose to fly by light category because it was cheapest with no check in baggage but I had to pay extra for the seat selection and there was no space to keep my cabin baggage because all the cabin spaces were full and were taken by the other co-passengers by the time I boarded the flight.

"1","Business Class Service Failure","What a disappointment of a company! If I could put 0 stars I would! 
First of all, as a travel agent in a big travel concierge company, I'll make sure, I'll spread the word around the travel industry regarding the business class experience that one of the passenger's received today on board!

Business passenger was humiliated on AirFrance today just because she asked for a glass of Prosecco. Unhappy stewardess - Lily Rosevel, gave the passenger a huge attitude as she was forced to walk 7 meters and look for that glass of prosecco. The passenger received her drink with the following remark: ""this is first and last prosecco you will get"". Which is a little strange for business class. 
Right after that, the passenger asked for a glass of water and after waiting for 40 minutes for it, she was forced to go and look for the stewardess in the kitchen to remind her she was still waiting for her water. After another 10 min, the stewardess finally got her half a glass. The passenger asked for more water and received not only the attitude but a letter that the French police will meet the passenger in Paris and that the staff won't serve her going forward. All passengers in business class were forbidden from talking to the passenger and she had to sit quietly on her sit scared and humiliated until the rest of the flight. 
What a shame! 
I would recommend everyone who wants to experience real business class treatment to avoid AirFrance and book with Emirates!","2022-10-28"

They delayed the flight to Paris which made me late for my next flight to Joburg. Once I got to the counter in Paris, they told me that I was late for my flight and that I would only travel at the following day at night.

Very unapologetic about the delay that was created by them, they did not offer me any alternative at all. I am so disappointed and will never never use travel with airfrance again","2022-10-27"

"2","Not the best experience 😔","Flight delayed at JFK - fault unknown, boarded flight to find French students taking any seat they wanted. Asked them to vacate our seats and they decided to take the pillow and cover with them. Really quite rude. Luckily it was an overnight flight so didn't need to endure the students too much but this was in between the seats being lowered and raised numerous times, making it difficult to keep tray stable and use inbuilt TV. Food was not good, I tried to contact airline via online booking to order a vegan/non dairy meal (as with Delta whom had this facility), but was given a choice of pasta or chicken, took the pasta which had egg and cheese in it - a medical incident could have ensued had I not checked the ingredients. Breakfast too included diary products so again nothing could be eaten, choose a black coffee instead. Not a pleasant experience.","2022-10-26"
"1","Very good after departure but incredibly bad on the ground","I was not allowed to take a small cabin luggage on board, saying the flight was full. When I arrived in Punta Cana, I had the surprise to see the luggage did not arrive. They promised to deliver it at the hotel the following day, but that didn't happen. The hotel tried calling Air France multiple times on both a mobile and fixed landline, but there was no answer. The connection at CDG was a nightmare, one hour is not enough to go from gates 2F to gates M. There was a lot of confusion, I had to run and even so I arrived almost last minute. After departure, the staff were professional, the entertainment system is good but the ground experience ruins the entire trip. CDG is like an airport from a third-world country, old infrastructure and grey decrepit buildings. I will definitely use KLM for other trips.","2022-10-26"
"1","Worst airline ever","On our outbound flight our luggage was mit delivered with us (can happen). However, it was very complicated to get help from the customer service. It took us two days to receive a confirmation about how to get our luggage. On our flight back home, the original flight was delayed, so it was not safe that we would geht our connecting flight. So Air France rebooked us to a new (really bad) flight at the next day without our confirmation and without oportunities to choose other options. We were noticed 7 hours before original departure. They sent us a link in a very unserious e-mail, where we were supposed to get help, but the website of the link was not available. Also the customer service was unreachable via phone. At the airport the Air France staff told us to buy a new ticket. We complained about this, since we did not rebook ourselves. It took them around 4 hours (without communicating with us) until they gave us the confirmation, to take our original flight. 

Overall we have to say that things like delayed luggage or flights can happen. But the way the customer service of Air France handled the situation, was the worst service we have ever had!! 

Who would have thought that Air France would be the worst transport company (Tsaradia Air, Cotisse Bus, El Condor) on our three weeks journey through Madasgacar.
We will never fly with Air France again.","2022-10-24"

Arrived at CDG and transferred effortlessly to the LPA flight.  Cabin crew again were very efficient and helpful.  The return journeys were equally as good.  Pleasant surprise to have snacks and drinks provided on board, and no hard selling of goods or scratch cards, like most UK flights seem to do.  Cannot comment on hold luggage reliability as we only had cabin luggage.  We found it a very pleasant time NOT having the usual holiday makers found on the UK airlines, who can be at best loud, excitable, rowdy and sometimes argumentative.  Would we use AF again? Yes.","2022-08-28"

"5","Amazing crew","I must say that I am impressed by the Air France flight crew.  I recently flew from NY to Bangalore with a connection in Paris with my wife and 12 month old son.  I know what your saying and I must say.  It was exactly what you would expect it to be.  A nightmare!  We had everything planned (my wife did I just follow orders) from the flight time, connection, food, sleep etc so that our child could have as smooth as a trip as possible.  From NY to Paris we we golden.  Smooth as silk.  We took off he ate and slept.  We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed.  Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began.   
He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off.  Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon).  He was rejecting all toys and foods.  The lady behind us asked my wife "" Is he going to be like that the whole flight?""  After some back and forth with the other passenger, ourselves and the flight crew we took off.  It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them.  It was an out of body experience.  Our son has never been so miserable.  I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable.  Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire.  
  The only bright spot was the flight crew.  Which is the reason for the review.  I have to give credit where credit is due.  They were simply amazing.    Very empathetic and supportive.  Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasnt just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available.  BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers?  I found that interesting and dont know why.  Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days.
My salute to the air crew that day.  You saved us and we are truly grateful.  We will remember this day for a long time not only because of the difficulties we had with our son but for the care and help we received from the crew","2022-08-25"

This is something you can understand and give grace about seeing as many bags have been lost this summer with a shortage of airline employees, HOWEVER, they have refused to help me. My bag has been los for 6 weeks now. At 21 days they have you filll out a form to try to sort out reimbursement, well i filled it out 3 weeks ago and they never said a word and certainly never sent reimbursement. When i finally got them on the phone, after many tries and hours of holding, they told me there was nothing they could do and i would just have to wait for the claims dept to finally contact me. Did not offer to put me inc on tact via phone or give ma a direct email for claims dept, they just said there was nothing they could do and i was stuck waiting to see if they’d ever care to help me.

If you want to try do this on the phone with someone the automated voice tells you “they can’t help anyone right now sorry, please use the app”. An absolutely shambolic airline and I’d recommend using a row boat across the English Channel before flying Air France.

I went in twice to the airport to find out about my bags, the manager at the ticket counter,  was rude and not helpful. She want to get rid of me quick without offering a solution.
One of bags came in on 8/15 on flight AF334, but no one went to get from the customs. 
I have to go back again on the 17th,  because they re too  busy to call me.

We had to repack the bags last minute in case the checked luggage gets lost.

Ask staff on board if our bags had made it, they lied and said yes. On arrival Singapore they had not. Told various lies about when they would arrive etc. 2 arrived after 5 days, again lies about the 3rd bag. Start of holiday ruined and cancelled further trip as no bags. Communication and excuses pathetic. 4 weeks later the bag is declared lost. Claimed for necessaries on arrival, even keeping to a minimum this was £700 and a waste of holiday time. They repaid this money within days of my claim. Lost bag claim going through but they don't make it easy. I am Platinum for life with AF and was told many times I am priority. If that's priority I feel for others who are not","2022-07-07"
"1","Poor management of flights","Check in poor as AF had not uploaded our flights. No queues for priority but did not matter with uploading issue. Lounge not the best and over full. They allow 85 minutes for a 45 minute flight time. Due to poor hand baggage control we were delayed and arrived late
Our flight had been changed by AF as they cancelled our original flight connecting to Singapore. We flew a day earlier to connect and left us with a short transit time of 65 minutes. The delay meant we had about 20 minutes, fortunately the flights arrived/departed at the same gates","2022-07-07"
"1","Air France couldn’t care less","Only 2 of our 3 bags made it home to Miami from CDG. Since no one will ever answer the phone, we had to drive to the airport twice to try and locate my bag. The first time, no one from Air France was even at the airport unless they had a flight coming or going. So yet another hour drive to MIA looking for my bag. They have no idea where my bag is and I don’t think I will ever see it again. I am beyond upset as one can imagine. How can my bag be lost when it has my name, address and phone number on it?  Leads me to believe someone is now enjoying its contents.","2022-07-07"
"1","My first experience","First time we preferred to travel Delta operating Air France and felt worst experience in my lifetime Air travel experience since 1985 in different Air craft. Reason behind is we lost one of the checking in bags which contains our life saving medicines.

No positive response so far that shows rank in inefficiency. Seeking legal options for being mentally depressed.","2022-07-07"

Then I COVERED my suitcase with my work monitors in fragile stickers and out of all my luggage it is the only thing damaged! Not only was my suitcase all cracked up but my monitors are damaged to the point were they can no longer be used. I wrapped them in a down comforter and placed fragile stickers all over! Now that I filed a claim on this 3 weeks ago I still have not received any feedback! And when I call to check on my claim the phone just hangs up. I experienced issues at the beginning middle and end of this booking and I am still going through issues getting compensated for my damaged goods. The customer service reps are rude and the overall customer experience is not worth what they charge. I fully plan on getting in contact with the BBB about this airline. I highly suggest a different airline. Turkish airline is way cheaper anyway! Don’t waste your money here! Nothing but a headache. Trust me!","2022-07-06"
"1","Baggage lost for more than 3 weeks with no help","The worst experience I have ever had taking a flight. 
First, the check in lines were long and there were clearly not enough staff for it. 
Second, the flight delayed for over an hour due to bad arrangement of flights.
Third, more than 5 baggage were lost in a flight which causing a long queue on the luggage center. However, there were only two staff there.
Here comes the worst thing. The staff promised to deliver the missing baggage to my address within a week. Turn out it is still missing while I am writing this comment, which is almost a month since my flight. I tried different methods to contact Air France and it is really hard to call them. There is a email that you will never get a response. There exists a phone number but you had to wait for at least 35 minutes before they pick up your call. I Called a lot in these three weeks ,wasting a lot of times but no one really could help. I went to the airport, imagining someone can help if I meet them, but the baggage service center was closed and all other staffs told me they can do nothing. So basically if you take Air France and the baggage is lost during the flight, you will not be able to do anything and no one from Air France can help you.","2022-07-04"

"1","Worst experience I have ever had.","Ground crew was extremely RUDE! 
I asked for help with their self serve baggage process. I said can you please help me with this and she rolled her eyes and said NO! 
Then I am finally relieved to be boarding the plane. When I put my ticket on the scanner that would open the door it wouldn't open. The attendant then took my ticket and my passport but wouldn't tell me why. I asked what the matter was and she said just stand there. Then she had loud words with her co-worker.  It turned out it was just a random check but they could have said this. I was sincerely worried I wasn't going to make my flight. I was the first in line and the last to board. 
When I arrived back in Seattle 2 thirds of the plane received their bags in a timely manner. The rest of us waited for 45 minutes and asked the Air France attendant if more bags were expected to come. She said ""Are you stupid look at the sign""! And she said no more bags were expected. 
So I told her this doesn't make sense. They had 1/3 of my flight that still needed our bags but they also had many bags on the same baggage claim that were not picked up. So I approached her again to point this out and again she said are you stupid! She said of course there is a problem because there is a strike. Just then the rest of the bags came up! 
You literally couldn't pay me to ever fly with Air France again. I am a frequent flyer and this is by far the worst experience I have ever had. Things happen but the least they can do is care. No madam I am not stupid and you and your co-workers are rude at best. You should be ashamed of yourselves and should find a new career that doesn't involve helping people. Air France doesn't deserve my business.","2022-07-04"

"1","Airfrance are awful  how they treat families not recommended","AirFrance are the most awful airline we have ever flown with. They knew well in advance about my Sons extra needs with mental health issues (ADHD) and a stomach disease and seemed to do everything to make us unhappy and made my son unwell, to the point he nearly collapsed after we landed. They happily let him starve the long haul flight and did nothing when he was screaming in pain. 
We asked them for nothing but just simple things like not sitting my 5 and 9 year old the other side of the plane to us which they tried to do and wouldn’t help us fix it l, another stress we had to sort outselves.
No one from Airfrance and we were passed round everyone in person wanted to help us. 
So many things went wrong the list is endless and causes so much stress and wrecked the start of our holiday. On the way home we had no choice but to keep paying more and more money just to make sure normal needs were met. We raised a complaint as it was so bad this was two weeks ago and we have heard nothing. 
To top it off we have been treated terrible and they lost all of our luggage containing both my sons sentimental items and special items from my wedding and family members not here anymore. 
Do not consider using Airfrance so many other lovely airlines.","2022-07-02"

I made a complaint at least to be reimbursed my luggage cost as I have to purchase bags during my return trip as I was unable to use the old one due to the conditions. 

I once admired airfrance but now regretted taking that flight. I have also recommended it to my friend who also had an extreme nightmare with the company and blamed me for misleading her and her family to travel with the worse airline ever. I felt so ashamed.","2022-07-02"

I fill out a claim telling them exactly where to send the bag and sure enough they put it on the wrong flight and sent it to the wrong place. On top of that they said they’d email me when it arrives (again at the wrong place) and they never did! It’s been 2 weeks and I filed another complaint and got no response. I had to spend $100s of dollars in a foreign country and they don’t even have the decency to reach out. I try calling but I’m on hold forever and then they just hang up. I will never fly Air France again and you should avoid this airline at all costs!","2022-07-01"
"3","Mediocre","This review is based on three different business class flights.

The first leg was from NY, JFK to Paris CDG. The plane was big, my business class seat was comfortable, with enough storage space. They gave us an envelope with mask, wipes etc... Masking was not required but encouraged. I cannot say the plane was clean, there were crumbs around my seat. The entertainment was good, the food was average... I had requested vegetarian and they offered me foie gras !! My risotto was ok, a bit greasy. Overall it was ok. 

The second leg Paris CDG to Yerevan EVN  was horrible. The business class seat was just a regular coach seat that barely reclined. The only difference between back of cabin and business class was that they kept an empty  seat between me and the other guest. They also had food service that was horrible. Overall I would give this leg of my trip only one star.

The third leg was Paris CDG to JFK. Similar to my first leg, it was a decent business class seat with enough storage room. Food was mediocre and entertainment was good. Overall the plane could have been cleaner. In general flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Plane left on time and arrived on time.","2022-07-01"
"1","Worst travel experience of my life and i've traveled a bit","First of all they have  problems with  their staff as all their staff are on stike.  So is it any wonder that the customers are also not happy? 

Flew feom babkok and it was 2 anf a half hours kate. Most people on the plane mised their conection flights and all Air France did  was keep saying sorry. Sorry soryy sorry. So sick of hearing them apoligumude. Apologies are not going to get me my money back or get me home on time for work etc. 

 Then when on the plane  they served the meal and drink within the first hour and nothing again until 8 hours later, 1 hour just before we landed. I was  starving and dehidrated. Thd staff was sitting i t  Le Bar for over 8 hours just chatting. 

They served the snack at the end of the flight and missed of out pastry roll .  

Staff rushing up and  down  kept knocing into me ever when i was moving for them. 

Transitted at CDG airport. I ran all the way and just made it too the plane for Newcadstle.  When i got  off in Newcastle  my case was lost. What a nightmare. Eventualy they found it  in CDG.  They hadn't loaded it onto the plane  too Newcastle.  I spent three days with only one pair of pants. All they could do was say sorry  sorrry sorry. So sick of them saying sorry. Sorry  doesn't fix the fact i lived in one pair of pants for almost 3 full days.  

Sort yourself out Air France!! Needless to say i will  avoiding them like the plague  from now on  .","2022-06-30"

"1","Punked by Air France - Switched from a Non-Stop to Paris to a Bad Connection on Aeromexico via Cancun","I booked a flight for my wife on Air France from Mexico City to Tunis via non-stop to Paris and connecting flight to Tunis.   About 30 hours before departure she received an e-mail from Air France stating an ""Operational Change"" - her non-stop to Paris was now stopping in Cancun to pick up additional passengers and would not allow enough time to transfer in Paris to her connecting flight in Tunis.   So, Air France booked her on an Aeromexico flight to Cancun.   We immediately realized that the new itinerary didn't allow enough time to transfer in Cancun.  We are permanent residents of Mexico, which requires an exit stamp from Immigration at the airport of departure FROM Mexico.   In Mexico City, Immigration is inside of Security.   In Cancun, it's outside Security, which means when you land on a domestic flight, you can't walk to the connecting gate with your boarding pass - you need to go outside Security to the Immigration booth, get you exit card stamp, and go back through the Security line again.   We tried calling the Air France customer service number in Paris to try getting on an earlier flight to Cancun.   Air France's arrogant response was she needed to contact Aeromexico, because her initial flight was now with them.   We next contacted Aeromexico, and they claimed that since the reservation was with Air France, it was their responsibility to book an earlier flight with them.   So, my wife went to the airport in Mexico City early and went to the Air France counter in Terminal 1 to try to change her flight.   Again, the agent there said they could do nothing about it - it was Aeromexico's responsibility.  Next (at 11am), my wife needed to take a taxi over to Terminal 2, where Aeromexico leaves from.   The Aeromexico agent in Departures said that since her new reservation departs at 5 pm, they couldn't do anything about it until 2 pm.   So, she needed to go over to the Food Court and chill out for 3 hours.   When she came back at 2 pm, they again reiterated that it was Air France's responsibility to put her on an earlier flight to Cancun.   So, she checked in.   The flight to Cancun arrived 15 minutes late.   It took my wife an hour and 15 minutes to go out of Security area to ticketing and the Immigration booth, get her exit card stamp, and go through the Security line again, and find the Air France gate.   She made her flight to Paris with a minute to spare.   Unfortunately, her baggage didn't.   It's still in Cancun.   Aeromexico didn't transfer it to Air France, even on the later flight.   When she finally got to Tunis, the international lost baggage system traced it back to Aeromexico in Cancun.   Hopefully she'll get her luggage in Tunis by tomorrow night , before her tour leaves for the Atlas Mountains.
To summarize, Air France sold a non-stop ticket to Paris in bad faith.   The EU permits ""operational changes"" like an unplanned stop in Cancun to pick up additional passengers and dumping you on another airline that doesn't have any operational coordination for transfers, as long as it's done within 2 hours before departure.   Really no legal recourse for compensation for either the hassle nor the lost luggage.  Delta's  SKY TEAM  is merely a marketing alliance - in terms of accountability, there is none.  It's always ""the other airline's responsibility"".    We've encountered this situation twice before transferring between Delta and Aeromexico.","2022-05-09"
"1","Confirmed worst company ever","Decided to give another chance after some time and for the second time I confirmed it's the worst company ever.

Will definitely not give another chance. Horrible","2022-05-07"

The arrogance and the attitude of the personnel is just dreadful. I would not recommend this airline to anyone and avoid Charles de Gaulle if you can. You might save something with a stopover in CDG, but you'd be better off going to another major EU hub. This airport is not good for non-French citizens.","2022-05-07"
"1","Never again","They say you only get one chance to make a first impression.  Well, I was definitely not impressed and will never set foot on another Air France aircraft.  I have never experienced such a level of indifference and such rude service.  Our first flight from Florence to Paris was delayed by nearly 3 hours while we waited on the plane with very little communication about what was going on.  We of course missed our connection, but thankfully we’re rebooked on another flight a couple hours later (really the only thing they got right).  When we arrived in Detroit, there was no baggage.  The employee at the airport said that this is what Air France does.  Apparently every flight, every day they just don’t load luggage.  When we finally arrived in Minneapolis, airport employees told us again that this is what Air France does best.  Claim was made for the missing baggage. 

Fast forward 2 days and I come to find out our baggage was still in Florence and has yet to be loaded on a flight back to the US.  Glad my luggage got to hang out for a few more days.  Needless to say, 4 days it took for our luggage to arrive.  When I travel  anywhere in Europe again, I will avoid Air France and Charles de Gaulle airport.","2022-05-03"

I bought 2 tickets online and I have been trying to pay for the change in the return ticket if my daughter. I can't do it online because she is a minor and they don't take payments over the phone,  which is so frustrating.  I was sent to the airport to go pay. I travelled 50 km to get there and be told they don't accept any payment either. 

And it's at least 1 or 2 hours of waiting time to speak to an agent on the phone.  Every single time. Been doing this for about a week now.

"1","Charged Twice - Never directly book Air France, always use a travel agency","I booked a ticket via Air France on April 12, on April 13 , 12 hours later   I had to cancel due to my belief I had Covid. I called Air France to cancel and Nyver assured me that he had cancelled the ticket. I requested an email and he told me that he couldn’t do that. He could only give me his name. 

On April 14 my Covid test was negative and I booked another trip exactly like the one I had before. Same destination, same flight, same traveller, same credit card etc.

 And then AIR FRANCE charged me TWICE for the same flight.

The first ticket Locator: W3VK4K was never cancelled as Air France's  agent Nyver had assured me.

LOCATOR 3BCJOP ( the one I actually travelled with ) on April 18- 25 2022 
flights # AF 1127-968 -969-1726. 

The most amazing event was that at the check in counter the AirFrance agent saw I had 2 reservations and said nothing, I noticed in her demeanor. 

Both tickets were charged also to my boyfriends credit card.
I demand a credit for the first ticket from AirFrance.  I have read these in other reviews Air France rarely returns the money and never acknowledge that you cancel within the first 24 hours. Using a travel agent is best, they confirm with an email right away.

The plane out was delayed due to staff shortages which were known in advance but unfortunately as we were at the boarding gate we weren't informed of anything with no staff present, I'm not sure if this is the airline or the airports fault but unprofessional.

Once aboard the experience was good, the five of us were seated together and we got a drink and light snack on both flights which is always appreciated.

"2","Nightmarish experience at Sky Priority Check in at o'Hare","Today, I learnt my French grand ma was dying.  I booked a flight last minute, for myself and my 5 years old. My French friends who just came back from France told me I didn't need a Covid test. Phew, as I had to pack, in one hour, everything.
I show up at Sky Priority Check in. After a while, finally I was able to check in. They ask if I had a booster shot. I said yes and gave the date. They needed proof. Unfortunately, my records were not up to date. 

They tell me to get a covid test done at the airport, terminal 2. The nightmare is just starting. With my 3 pieces of luggage, my car seat and my 5 year old, I go to terminal 2 (from terminal 5). There? Nothing. I ask around, and they tell me to go to terminal 1. There? Nothing. They tell me to get on a bus to go by the rentals. Finally, I arrive, after 45 min going all around the airport with all my luggage and my kiddo. I don't have time anymore. . Takes me 5 min to ter 5.

I let them know that they sent me in the opposite direction. Did I get any excuse of any kind? Absolutely zero. zero. zero. They told me it was there, they sent people there earlier today? Seriously? Very very bad service.

I finally call the pharmacy, they send me a picture of my updated card they just did manually on the spot. Ouf.

BUT now, only now does the staff sees that my son's passport is not valid because it expires 2 month after return, So I went  on a wild goose chaseothing. And they never ever apologized.

"2","Horrible customer service","I find Air France customer service calamitous!

After booking and paying for a flight online, the Air France website tells me ""We have received your payment"". Also, I receive an email confirming the reservation.
About 2 weeks later, I learn (after 30 minutes of waiting on my 4th attempt to reach them by phone and while my 3 emails remained unanswered) that my reservation was canceled due to a payment problem.

I am told that there is no other solution: I have to redo the reservation by myself, modify my travel dates and pay 23% more!!!

I have since been trying to file a complaint (5 attempts already) on the Air France site but, as luck would have it, sending the complaint fails each time. Many companies purposely make filing a complaint complicated and time-consuming, so most unhappy customers give up on the way.

I would find that unworthy of a company such as Air France claims to be. I will not give up.","2022-04-22"

First he presents two types sandwiches in a tray with no explanation of what is on either, they are just held in front of you! I then asked for a cup of tea, to which he replied “tea please”! He then did the same with passengers in front of me as they laughed embarrassingly, stating manners mattered to him! If he had cared to listen he would have heard that I did say please, but too interested in his supposed superiority! I suggest he takes training in customer service and how not be so rude and to learn to speak clearly over the intercom, as he mumbled each announcement. He must also be aware that he is dealing with different languages and cultures and not just French speaking people whom may clearly understand him. He walked up and down aisle and missed a closed window blind for take off twice! If this is representative of Air France, then they have a problem and I would not choose to fly with them. Flight AF1735 Berlin to Paris 12.15 on 19th April 2022.","2022-04-19"
"5","Great service","We flew from Paris to Cairo then Back on Air France. We flew on Boing 777 both times. The seats were 2-3-2 layout. I was kinda concerned but found it ok. Going was an eveing flight and we were served adinner that was great. On the flight from Cairo to Paris it was very early flight 100am. They served breakfast just before landing. Both times service was super. Just wish the departure & arrival times were better.","2022-04-18"
"1","Missing Baggage Hell in Anantanarivo, Madagascar","Food was good, as expected.  In-flight service was average to below average. However, my bag did not arrive. I was told that the bag would arrive on the next flight (3 days out), and I had to come to collect it at the airport. Miserable start to a bucket-list vacation. Bought clothes and toiletries for the three days (no kit was available, no information on re-imbursement was available from Air France staff on the ground). Came to Airport on 4th day (my holiday schedule disrupted). Collected bag... inside was badly messed up with packets of snacks opened and spilled everywhere. No information on reimbursement at the point of pickup.  Filed compensation form, acknowledged but still no response at almost a month!  All the horror stories on Air France at the various sites are validated.  Had no other option  since only AF was flying to TNR at the time.  I wish I could say never again, but unfortunately they are the only game in town, relative to my oft-visited destinations and airline alliance membership!","2022-04-18"
"2","New Equipment, Generous Recline, Atrocious Service","Flying Blue miles provide average value for getting across the Atlantic. With amex membership rewards points, we were able to fly from Seattle to Italy round trip in an open-jaw itinerary for ~55,000 points + $250 per person. At the time of booking this netted us a total value of ~1.2 cents per point, though the availability of cheap fares if you look hard enough makes this an average value redemption big picture. Any value attained from a points booking is the last positive point of the flying experience.

Ground Experience:
Check in started the flight off on a bad note. Since we were booking with Flying Blue miles, Air France would not allow us to add our Delta frequent flyer numbers to the reservation, which would have entitled us to SkyTeam Elite Plus level benefits. Even though we were checking in in Seattle (one of partner Delta's hubs), Air France check in was handled by Swissport contractors who did not know what they were doing. Agent Thy was downright rude to us when we asked her to give us the elite benefits (like priority baggage tags) that we were entitled to. The funny thing was that even though we were denied priority baggage, our boarding passes were still marked with the priority boarding group. Boarding was also disorganized, between the lack of clear signage and the gate staff's lack of knowledge around the facial-recognition system that they were piloting. If you are a US citizen, the facial recognition system is only of some privacy concern since DHS states in their terms of service that images will only be kept for 12 hours. Noncitizens, however, are not entitled to the same rights, creating a compelling reason to opt out. Even so, the gate agents were not sure how to disable the machine when someone asked to be opted out.

IFE:
Though I did not use the IFE system to watch any movies, there appeared to be a large selection of English and French titles, and the moving map was comprehensive (no tail camera, though). Wifi was not functional for the duration of the flight.

Food:
While the presentation of the food was subpar, the food itself was slightly above average. Dinner was served rather late, so I decided to get to sleep before the service began. Upon waking up, I was able to venture to the rear galley, where flight attendants had sandwiches and other snacks available for hungry travelers. Breakfast was nothing great, but the warm pastry was satisfying enough before landing. 

Service:
While service on the ground was horrible, service in the air was slightly above average. Flight attendants were brisk but helpful throughout the duration of the flight.

Seat:
This flight was on a 787-9, a very comfortable ride. The pitch was a little tight, though the recline was very generous. The larger windows and higher cabin pressure also contributed to a pleasant hard product experience. 

Though we paid for this flight in miles, we were sure to pay the taxes and fees with the Amex Platinum, for its 5x points on airfare and trip protection benefits. Beware that these protections (as with any credit card), do not automatically offer the ability to cancel because of COVID-fears, only tangible effects (cancelations, delays, etc.)","2022-04-18"

My bag got lost for 3 days going to Cuba, when I finally got it half of its contents had been stolen.

I'm writing this from heathrow Airport while waiting for my bag again which didn't make the flight again despite being at the airport early and my friends getting here fine.

"1","Missing Christmas due to delay","On 24th of December i was travelling from Zurich to Oslo, with a connecting flight from Schipol, Amsterdam. Due to KLM taking too long time loading on the baggages from Amsterdam i lost my airplane, this was confirmed by the pilot when he apologized for the inconvience. 

I then applied for compensation as i am entitled to according to EU laws and regulations, however they refused to pay and said that the circumstances were ""extraordinary"" which they are not according to EU laws. I strongly advise staying away from this airline, one of the worst airlines i have had experiences with. I am currently in talks with my lawyer to proceed with legal prosecution, just as a matter of principle.","2022-01-12"
"1","Bad","On Air France's website, I carefully booked a round trip ticket where I'd have one baggage on my flight to Toronto and none on my return (I have screenshots too). Once I payed, I saw in my confirmation email that I got no baggages at all. I called, waited an hour, only for the agent not to know what to do. Fine, that's okay but when she tried to ""connect"" me to someone else, during the hold, they hung up on me. Did it again, and was hung up on again. Needless to say, I'm never flying with Air France again.","2022-01-11"
"1","Unreachable, no communication between offices","I have been booking my flights with Airfrance and KLM for the last few years as I am traveling between EU and US often. This time my flight got cancelled and my plans also changed due to covid and I had not been able to reach neither AirFrance or KLM on the phone. I am currently in EU but I purchased my ticked through the US website. When I finally reached the customer service on the phone they told me nothing can be done, because I need to reach out to the US office. My phone carrier is European and they have charged me $200 for making a US phone call. I am requesting compensation for that call from AirFrance. And the US number didn’t even pick up the phone after an hour of waiting, so I couldn’t even handle what I needed to! 
After trying again for a voucher I was told again that nothing can be done from Europe, but I should fill out a form for compensation in the us website. I did that but I hadn’t received any confirmation email, nothing about it for days. At this point my flight is supposed to go the next day and still nothing have happened! I am hugely disappointed in this company!","2022-01-11"
"1","Worst customer service","I've had the worst experience today, we were supposed to fly tomorrow morning with our two little kids. I tried to do an online checkin but got an error message that our tickets were cancelled. I thought it was a small mistake and that it could be fixed after talking to costumer service. 
I found out that our tickets never had benn issued, there had been some complication with the payment ( eventhough the money had been taken from my account). Even though I had gotten a booking confirmation after the payment had been done, and I had been logged in a chosen meals for the flight just days before. 
I was now told that the only thing I could do is book a new flight and pay the price that was now ( more than 1000euros more expensive) they wouldn't reimburse me in any way and they couldn't give me the same price as I payed for the first tickets.

I'm so happy that I found it out before I was in the airport with my two kids. But I'm so angry that I didn't get any information from AirFrance that my booking was cancelled and that I didn't get any tickets. 
I'm sad that my family holiday might not happen at all now.","2022-01-11"
"1","Horrible company to avoid","Air France lost my luggage twice, but the worst thing is that I bought a ticket and that plane was cancelled. The company took the liberty of changing my ticket without warning me at times that were not convenient for me. They are forcing me to either cancel my return flight or change my ticket for dates that don't suit me by charging me an extra 20 euros. It's just catastrophic from dublin better to fly with their competitor air lingus disgusted with their customer service and to get them on the phone you have to wait for hours and they hang up on me. i understand those who are unhappy appealing for consumer rights just abuse of power","2022-01-10"

Two days after they sent it with Air France airline to Cancun.
I got to know the flight number and went to the terminal just to collect it by the time the flight arrived. 
The Air France ground staff was so NOT helpful. They kept sending me off and told me to wait for 2 hours. Everyone was so rude and just wanted to get rid of me .
I tried to explain that I already spent 2 days without my luggage. 
I've been waiting for 2 hours in the terminal just to collect my bag when the flight had landed long ago.

"1","Fraudulent and Criminal!!!","I had a flight scheduled for December 28th, two days ago, to fly from Mexico CIty to Mumbai, India. About a week ago, I spent a good 40 minutes on the phone with a rep at Air France, going over EVERY requirement needed to successfully make the scheduled trip, including 2 different Covid tests (both PCR and antigen), myriad questionaires, app on my phone for India, etc. etc. Daunting, indeed, but I was determined to make it happen!
Well... I arrived at the airport, a good 4 hours ahead of time...got up to the check-in counter, handed in my heap of paperwork, then gave the agent my passport with my 10 year Indian visa inside of it (good until 2029.) The agent told me I could NOT get on the flight!!! Why??? Because, he stated, the Indian government wouldn't accept ANY visas issued before October 6th, 2021!! But WHY NOT??!!? I protested. My visa was issued by the INDIAN government, and it was good for 10 years!! Not any more, was his terse, unsympathetic response. I was stunned. I asked to speak to a supervisor; he claimed he WAS a supervisor (I didn't believe him--why was he working the check-in counter if he was supposed to be supervising the staff?!?)  He simply refused to let my on the fight. Shocked, stunned, disbelieving... I then asked to reschedule the flight, thinking I would do what was necessary, then, to get ANOTHER visa and get on a later flight. However, he claimed he could NOT reschedule another flight for me, because I would need to get a valid visa FIRST!! To which I protested, WHY was proof of this so-called ""valid"" visa NOT necessary, then, when I booked the flight in the FIRST PLACE?!!? You see the stupid, unbelievable, illogic of it all?!? Furthermore, why was it that--when I spoke to an AF agent DAYS ago--we went over EVERY requirement, or so I thought, and that person NEVER, EVER asked about my visa?!?!!?!? Shouldn't that have been the FIRST question asked?!!? 
So I left the airport, and 2 days later, called Air France to ask for a refund. After waiting on the phone for 45 minutes for an agent to answer, and then another 25 minutes on hold with the agent, I was told that I could NOT be issued a refund because I was appearing-- in her system-- as a ""no show""!!!! A NO SHOW?!??! Are you KIDDING ME?!!?!? I was livid, as you might well imagine. I asked for a supervisor--yes, again--and was told none were available. Clearly, I am going to have to dispute this now on my credit card and try to get a refund for the $915 spent on my one-way ticket to India. What a complete and total nightmare. Devasting. I will NEVER, EVER book another flight with Air France!!!!!","2021-12-31"
"3","Watch out for a Charles De Gaulle trap (or Air France)","This is not necessarily an Air france review, more the CDG Airport in Paris, as they were scamming everyone equally. I just happened to be on an Air France flight..

In the security line there was a special guy at the front of it who visually asessed you and your carry-on luggage. If he thought you are a good candidate for scamming, he pulled you over and made you go in a separate line, where your carry-on AND your personal item, which you were allowed to bring (like a ladies handbag, or in my case a computer bag) were weighed TOGETHER, and if its over the allowed 12 kilos, FOR BOTH, they made you check in your carry-on for an additional 60 to 100 euro, depending on your deal. The line of scammed people was long and easily amounted to several seats extra sold for a given flight.
I am not aware of anyone else doing it - certainly not in the USA.  BEWARE!!","2021-12-31"

"1","Very bad customer service - Bag issue","I booked through Delta but because of co-share flight I had to go with Air France. While the booking process (Delta), check in process, flight itself and on board service were good; the experience once landed has been below any possible expectation. 
I landed in Miami on Dec 17th and my bag was missing. Things happened. The person took my information. I received a call on Dec 19 (48 hrs after) telling me my bag arrived at the airport and will be delivered late night. Since then no news. No offer for any kind of assistance was made at any point with this situation. This is an extremely poor customer service experience, which give a very bad taste to the entire flight experience. AF didn't follow up, neither offer assistance with anything.","2021-12-21"

"1","Avoid if possible","The only good thing I can say about this airline is that the plane arrived on time. Their planes are so old that you feel like flying in time mashine. The things that are supposed to make your 10hr flight less uncomfortable are either not working (movies, music etc.) or almost non existent (onboard service). Food is barely edible, to get something to drink tou have to wait hours for stewardess to walk through the aisle offering water, soda or disgusting, warm wine. Definitely the worst thing about this airline is organisation or rather disorganisation at the airport. Damaged luggage is a must, but consider yourself lucky if your luggage arrived to the same country as you did - the same airport is a luxury. To get a sit next to your co-travellers you have to beg for it or slip 20$ into your passport at departure. To complete the image i must say that all of the staff speaks only their native language with some bits of english and sign language to communicate with customers.","2021-09-26"

"1","Worst experience","I have traveled all over the world and this was definitely the worst experience I have ever had. The people at the Paris airport were disorganized and rude. 30 minutes before our flight (when we had been sitting there over 4 hours) they tell us we need this form filled out online before we can board. The form wouldn't load on our phones and when we asked if we could use the iPad one of the customer service representatives was holding to complete it, she said no. When I told her it wasn't working on our phones she said there was nothing she could do and repeated ""if we don't fill it out we don't board."" There was another elderly man having a hard time with the form and asked for help aswell. She gave him the same response. As I was standing next to her trying to get the form to load a woman came up and said she needed a wheelchair to board the plane. The representative told her she should have requested it a long time ago. The lady said she did and no one ever brought her one. The representative said it was to late now and walked away from her. I asked to speak to a manager and the manager basically said Oh well about the horrible customer service, but we were able to board.","2021-09-23"
"5","Quick to Act, Zero Stress","Unfortunately the connection flight was missed due to a small delay on the first flight. Looking at the schedule the only option was to get a flight the next day… here I am prepping for 12 hours in an airport.

Air France were amazing and when we went to the service desk in Paris they without question issued new tickets, provide accommodation with tea and breakfast, gave each passenger a voucher to use in the airport, provide essentials for hygiene and gave clear insurrections of how to get to the hotel and then what to do in the morning.

Delays happen - the service Air France provided to make up for it was better than I could of imagined. I would certainly use them again for a connecting flight.","2021-09-20"
"1","Worst business class experienced eve","Check in…hurry up and wait, and wait and wait.  It is unfortunate that check in personnel are required to make sure passengers adhere to COVID testing and vaccination protocols, as it seriously hampers check in. However, they should quickly remove a passenger who hasn’t met the criteria rather than allowing them to stay and argue and hold up everyone else. While our check in went smoothly, the agent neglected to tag our check in bags as priority.  We were offered a choice of water, wine or champagne prior to take off, and the attendant was exasperated because i took the last glass of champagne on her tray.  Meal time came, a flurry of four attendants running around with iPads…We were served “luncheon” not the dinner shown on our reservation.  I was offered a glass of wine at the start of the meal, and requested the Chardonnay shown on the menu.  The attendant said I’d have to have what was open!?  The meal arrived, AWFUL.  Attendant asked me if I liked my meal, since most was uneaten…and I honestly answered “no”.  Several other passengers were similarly disappointed, and they’re was another ipad bearing attendant asking select passengers to take a survey about their meal.  I hoped to get a second splash of wine, but no one offered.  During flight NO ONE came through the aisle to offer water or soft drinks.  I went up to the galley to request some water, and after getting a frosty stare, was told to use the water bottle at my seat!  As the staff prepared for landing, some flight attendants has US customs forms, but I wasn’t given one, so I asked for one.  I was told, inaccurately, that I didn’t need one…The customs officer gave us a lecture for not preparing one.  Won’t fly Air France ever again.","2021-09-20"
"1","By far the worst airline I've ever encountered","This is the first time that I have flown with Air France. My expectation when booking the flight was that I would arrive within the time specified on the booking. 
However, due to the subsequent lack of coordination and organisation, I, along with many other customers were delayed by over 1hour and missed the connecting flight. This led to an 8 hour wait inside the airport, with face masks permenantly on. This delay  was of significant inconvenience and as a result I tried to contact customer services to ensure that I would have sufficient time to catch the connecting flight on my return journey.

However, for the  5 days that I tried to contact the airline, I was on hold for an average of 30 mins at a time with calls being terminated before I was able to connect to an adviser. When I was finally connected, I was advised that I may try and alternative route (to the internal flight) to connect to my flight back to my country . I then payed the extra money to get to the airport to ensure that I would not be stuck in a que as I was on my incoming journey, leading me to miss my connection. After a 6 hour wait, I was advised that I would not be able to board the flight.
I was left to navigate my was back to the entrance from which I arrived. Which took around 60 mind with heavy bags. 
Although I eventually managed to communicate the issue with a member of staff. The lack of empathy and honesty from the airline staff at the boarding gate for the flight  was astonishing. They did not care that I had life threatening emergency and it was not until the flight left, that I was able to speak to a member of staff . I was again greatly inconvinienced. This has been a very traumatic and depressing experience. This airline is not in anyway customer focused.","2021-09-19"

I was told I would receive a full refund but it could take up 60-90 days.  It has been 30 days since the conversation with Air France rep and I still have not received $870.00 of my money or explanation for the cancellation of my flight.

Their booking system left me without any notification that there was a delay in my flight, I was left stranded in Paris for 25 hours instead of the original 3 I should have spent there, I was denied boarding onto a flight that evening because I couldn’t print my boarding pass, even though a customer service rep from Air France told me that I just needed to arrive to the check out desk with my reservation number. I was denied. I was told to run back to the Air France customer service to book another flight for the following day which I had to pay for even though it was their mistake!!! My bags were about to fly off to Tbilisi without me until I begged the baggage reclaim area to stop the flight from taking off and retrieve them minutes before take off from cargo. Air France woman that forced me to pay extra for the next flights was just like “if you want your bags go down to floor 0 and call for help” oh wow woman do you know how hard it was to figure out what you meant!?
I wasn’t even put up in a lounge after my original delay, I had to pay for my own hotel in Paris, it took me over 6 weeks and 7 phone calls to Air France to get anybody to read my claim.

A total nonsense, a company who use to manage money with no respect! All Borders closed, Travel ban, Global Pandemic, this company is a scandal, fraud, bad system , unprofessional, they grab over 3800 euros of my money with no reason why. This is what u get if u travel with AIRFRANCE & KLM. They hidden themself from a company to another. I never asked money but just the chance to travel and move my original trip to Summer 2022. I WILL NOT TRAVEL AGAIN WITH AIR FRANCE & WILL START A LEGAL ACTION despite all their excuses.","2021-09-07"
"1","Skip Air France if you can, they just add stess to your life","Too long didnt't read : Air France is at fault and owes us money.

I wanted to let you know of a situation we are currently in. My fiancee and I are getting married next week
 I booked for my Fiancee a flight from Haneda to Paris online. 
Today she tried to change some settings and it comes up with an error.
She calls up Air France Japan "" which pick up right away"" to then tell her the payment never went through.
In a panic she calls me at 3am and i check my online banking and see the money was taken. 
I try calling and calling their lines once they open but keep getting the same message 
""we are sorry our lines are too busy and we can't help you"" then hangs up.
After 10 attempts i try the "" join flying blue line"" which picks up within 8 minutes.
The staff member tells me there was a web ticket error on their end so the booking never happened.
I have to rebook, i had to rebook at a much higher price AND they won't refund me for several weeks
The amount they already took or make any gesture towards the price even though it was their fault 100%

Air France don't take care of their customers and keep your money to make interest. Don't trust them.
I am still awaiting to see if my Fiancees plane will even take off after hearing all the stories with Air france.

The most disturbing thing is, Air France doesn't even try and help. They never called, sent an email or anything to warn us
about the issue that had happened. I kept my calm and tried so hard 
but in the end yelling is the only way to get things done.

I will be filing a complaint. The customer service is 0/10 and trip advisor really needs a 0 there, we aren't treated like humans. The phones, Twitter, Facebook don't respond. All i see everywhere is probably 9/10 bad reviews and once in a while a miracle happens. This is a rant because we are stressed enough as it is about a wedding and Air France just complicated everything. I can't imagine what would've happened if she went to the Airport when she was suppose to fly and be refused...

"1","Horrible","This flight, bad enough at 4:15 am, was shockingly bad for what used to be a premier airline.  The plane was a beat up old Airbus 318 or 19 that had no business class seats. Instead, they left the middle seat open and sold them as business class. There was no entertainment system, no leg room, very little recline. They have no right selling these for business class rates. They were actually sold to me by Delta, operated by Air France. Shame on both of them.","2021-09-04"
"1","Take the Eurostar!","I had booked my return flight some time ago, when Eurostars were limited and pricey, and I was planning to have quite bulky luggage to check in. 
So, here's the story! [Class: Economy | Frequent Flyer: Platinum for Life].

It all started with the original flight booked being cancelled and me being reschedule on the last flight in the evening. Online check-in would not accept me, ""because of the need for a document check"", which actually interferes with providing your seat in the PLF - Gov.uk being fortunately more flexible in its online forms than Air France.
At check-in, I am directed to the Sky priority line, which does not seem that busy with a few customers and 3-4 desks open. I'm waiting for some time when the staff member at the closest desk starts taking selfies with passengers (I missed whether they were celebrities, but surely that wasn't social distancing at 1 meter and with the mask down). After which he probably had enough of working, and came to me directing me to another desk where ... I kept waiting (a good 10 minutes despite hardy anyone being there). Eventually I get my luggage checked-in, and I am allocated a middle seat because ""the flight is full"". I inquire whether this is consistent with social distancing only to hear that ""this does not apply when the flight is full!"". I'm also told that the flight will depart from L (we're in 2E) but nothing else.
Once I arrive at the terminal, the Lounge has closed since 16:00 and the other lounge does not accept AF passengers nor Priority Pass card holders. I get back to an AF ""help"" desk (quotes definitely needed). All I'm offered is to get back to K (but these are different airsides, with separate security) and regarding the full flight I am told that they have this wonderful system that renews cabin air every 3 minutes (NOTE: a different answer from the previous one).
After a couple of hours roaming the terminal, we eventually get on board, where 'priority boarding' means waiting 10 minutes standing in the jetway. 
On board, one thing they certainly did not lie about was that the flight was full (bar perhaps a couple of business seats). 20 minutes delay ""to wait for more passengers"" and more on-board waiting in a crammed flight.
One cabin crew comes to greet me (with a 25cl water bottle), as they always do when you are Plat-for-life but I suggest that, while he is obviously at the receiving end of a complex dysfunctional chain, I would rather have ""good customer service with no on-board greetings"". The next announcement is that they won't be any in-flight service due to the Covid situation.
During the flight, as much as I could see, several passengers within my FoV took their mask down completely (without drinking or eating) or wore it on their mouth only. Cabin crew did not seem to care at all, although they were nowhere to be seen, since there was no in-flight service. 
Flight continues, and more chaos when disembarking where the old recommendations of maintaining distance and disembarking by rows seem to have gone overboard.
Overall, I am not convinced by their in-flight measures, despite the upbeat ""award-winning"" health & safety measures tone of their web site. Does air recycling work when people next to you don't wear their mask properly? Why you would have 1 metre social distancing throughout the airport and all of a sudden be elbow to elbow with 2 people? 
What would be even worse would be that the cancelled the previous flight for yield management just to cram everyone onto the next one in the above conditions.","2021-09-04"

Today, I called to change my flight since I have not received the covid-documents necessary to enter Chile. I made sure that my new flight was also Premium Economy. In fact, I asked several times and paid a difference. However, when I received my new electronic ticket I was downgraded to Economy. 
So I called again and again waited for an hour. This time I was told by a very arrogant assistent that there was nothing to do about it and that ""the system"" was to blame for the downgrade. I could pay an additional 600 USD or cancel my flight. Really????   
Why do I have to pay for an error in your system? 
I ended up cancelling my flight and will now have to buy another at a higher price. But it will not be with AirFrance. Shame on you.

"1","Stay away at all costs","“Cancelled” the flight of my significant other without notifying us and yet boarded flight to Paris (they told us on the phone when sitting in the airplane boarded because the flight to Slovenia was cancelled and we needed to rebook that flight). 

In France they said they don’t know how she got there if her tickets were cancelled, but she received an email to check in.
Flight was to Slovenia and next flight was not until 5 days later. Every person that helped was polite, but completely clueless with what their supervisors were telling them. 

Not being able to book her on a different flight to get home same day from a different airline because they didn’t know their COVID rules until 2 hours later (20 minutes before the flight took off) they got her a ticket to a neighboring country that she now has to get a cab to take her to the boarder to get picked up.

Our surprise was when they took 75% of the total amount! They only return 25% of the ticket and didnt even provide a voucher.

I think, i should get full refund associated with reimbursement of hotel charges and next ticket because they cancelled my ticket without notification and also i dont know anybody in Delhi who can help me. I strongly believe that they have put my life risk by not informing me about cancellation.

"1","Complete rip off!","Booked a flight to fly 7th Jan on 3rd Jan flying on this airline as it said travelling through France you needed a stat declaration. It was dearer but I was only transiting so thought to avoid other country PCR tests.
To my surprise on booking they took my payment then advised I needed a new antigen test.
No one had a clue what this was so rang around all day finding a myriad of departments without clue so I got the PCR done on 4th.
That evening returning home England went in to lockdown on late night news.
Next morning I rang Air France multiple times over three hours trying to get through on every occasion I got cut off no matter what the wait times were.
So before days end I requested to cancel and refund.
Two choices it’s your choice or them cancelling a flight!
No explanation comment section.
I cancelled then rang up PayPal who said they’d ring me back if any info was required.
Air France who couldn’t provide the flight from the UK stated their flights were available from France itself and PayPal accepted this until I rang back saying I had the cancellation and six recordings of the attempts of getting through and I was advised to go through my bank which I did.
Air France were quite happy to take money for no service at all even though the service couldn’t be provided.
Hours wasted and loads of stress! I’d never use this airline again! 
Plus I was to receive a confirmation email for the refund request which funnily never came.","2021-02-18"
"4","Nice flight, great customer service support","What travellers need right now is flexibility in the ticket dates, i got excellent support from AF and KLM. I had to change my flight date 3 times, they always helped, i will remember this.
This flight was better than my outward journey, the organisation and paperwork checking was professional and courteous in both GRU and CDG. 
The flight itself offered very good service, nice food (although i was confused with a tray serving all courses bar the hot main), and i slept far better than the outbound, i dont know why. My main gripe is the same as the outbound - toilets and capacity. Having to wait over 30 mins to use a toilet in business class is unacceptable, only 1 small toilet for 36 persons is not enough. 
 Very good performance from AF, they are now on my list (along with KLM) of European airlines to use for all my families flights.","2021-02-16"
"2","Incompetent","I used to fly with Air France many times and never had any issues until today. I am polish living and working in U.K. with settlement status. My job require me to travel a lot and I’ve been traveling extensively during COVID. I arrived to the airport 2 hours before departure. Because of the COVID I had to wait 50min which is understandable. Then it was my turn...I’m handing my passport, she checking it and here how our conversation goes:
- I can’t find you on the system, under what name did you book your ticket?
- I didn’t book the ticket, it was booked by travel agent but it is under my name...let me check confirmation...
I’m handing over my phone with flight booking - she is clearly confused. Then she is waiting for her colleague to help her...after 2 min
- ok, I found your name but I can’t check you in
- what do you mean you can’t check me in?
- I’m not sure why...let me ask
Again, she is waiting for colleague to help her...
Then she’s starting going through my passport...
- where is your visa?
- what visa?
- you need a visa to enter U.K.
- I don’t need a visa, I have settled status
- what is settled status?
- it means that I can live and work in U.K.
- have you got anything to prove it
- I don’t need anything to prove it to you, I can enter using my passport
She is clearly lost
- I need to ask my supervisor - supervisor comes...
They both reading what I need to enter U.K.
After a moment supervisor:
- do you have anything to prove your settled status..
I’m completely off guard...taking my phone and logging to immigration website and showing proof of my settled status.
Supervisor:
- you need to print it. Go to ticket office and they will print it for you...
- are you sure that I need to print it?
- yes, that’s what system says
I’m going to the ticket office and there is a queue...so in the meantime checked on internet if I need anything and the answer is no. To make sure, I called Manchester airport immigration helpline, they confirmed that I don’t need to print anything and can enter using my passport.
So I’m heading back to check in...
- I just had a chat with Manchester immigration office and they saying that I don’t need to print anything
Supervisor:
- system is saying that you need to print it and this is the newest update so it’s right.
Now I’m annoyed...
- last time I checked British boarder force was following British law and guidelines not Air France 
They didn’t like this comment but at least they shut up and started reading what system actually says:
After couple of minutes supervisor says:
- you need locator form
- I’ve got it - handing over my phone
- you need to print it
- I don’t need to print it, I’ve been entering U.K. multiple times in the last few months and never printed it
- it obviously changed since last time
So I quickly checked on the gov site which confirmed that I can have it on my phone
- British gov site says that I don’t need to print it
This is where supervisor got really annoyed.
- look, I don’t care what some website says, you need to print it...I can print it for you or not?
- whatever...

And that was it... I was almost refused to board the plane only because Air France employing people which are incompetent and struggling to read English.","2021-02-09"
"1","WORST CHECK-IN Experience","Today, February 8th 2021, at LAX, I tried to check into my flight for Amsterdam. I provided all my documents: My PCR test, antigen test, all stating that I am negative, as well as my passport, and a work permit from my employer. However, one of the supervisors said I needed an IND immigration letter stating I am able to come to Amsterdam. I had looked all over on your site and the IND site searching if I needed such document for a short stay, less than 14 days, humanitarian work trip. Nothing was said. Three other supervisors, including the pilot were all confused by this, but this woman had me not board the plane because of this one document. I'm so confused why she was convinced I needed this document when I have all the other documents provided. Please help me understand, I spent a lot of money and 6 hours of my day at the airport talking to her and now I am missing out on work. :(","2021-02-08"
"1","Choose another airline, drive, get a boat, walk... anything but use this airline","Flew with them for the first time and it was a 7 hour flight. The whole time every single cabin crew seemed like they wanted no one on the plane. But the plane was jam packed. Zero leg room, tiniest of aisles, it was very cramped and you would have thought due to covid they would have reduced the number of seats available to keep people spread apart. But no, I might as well have been cuddling the person next to me. 

Crew were the rudest people I have ever met, dealt with a few French people recently and it seems to be common that they are brought up with no manners. They should think about hiring staff who know how to crack a smile and let you go to the toilet. Tried to get past them whilst they were serving, not the ideal time but I needed to go... plus I have seen many people go during service, and the crew kindly move down to an empty seat so you can get past and they can carry on.

They didn't even acknowledge my existence. And when I asked to get past the woman just said I am serving go away. Then the other one came right up behind me and asked me to move out the way, not grasping the concept of me standing there thinking they would realise that I needed the toilet. 

When I eventually got past and went, I came out and another member of staff walking straight into me and didn't apologise. 

The way they spoke to people was disgusting. All rude, ignorant and don't care about anyone on the flight.  Considering I flew with Emirates on the way out there, the difference in service, manners and attitude towards passengers  is massive. I expected similar flying long haul with these but they clearly can't be bothered learning how to do it properly.

Aside from that, the food was awful,your packed in there like sardines and can't move, the in flight entertainment is basic to say the least and once again the crew are rude, miserable, unhappy and terrible at their jobs. 

Don't fly with these. Find another way.","2021-02-05"
"1","Air France is the worst for dealing with customers","I was travelling from Dublin to Cairo (via Paris) and got denied boarding in Dublin due to missing “Health Declaration Form”, apparently this form had to be printed and filled out before traveling to Cairo and was denied boarding. When I requested any evidence/paper with denying reason they refused. Ugly fact, this “form” authorities actually distribute it in the airplane after landing and in the airport before passport control. When we re-booked our flight (next available flight was only the NEXT day) and traveled from Paris to Cairo, it appeared we were the ONLY passengers on board that already filled out this form. Therefore, our initial boarding should NOT have been denied! The whole situation was completely unnecessary and dealing with people on the gates was extremely ugly and unprofessional from their side.","2021-02-04"

The excellent service and rich menu selection experienced in former AF long distant flights were completely missed in the end of January 21 flight. Despite of just 8 passengers in the Business cabin and have been asked as third passenger for selection, the chosen meal was not available (""since too many have selected it..."") so I have not taken any...My colleague in the same cabin was served with the wrong versus selection.
After a single glas wine the empty glas was removed by the staff wile passing by without asking for additional wishes; and slow reaction after call...There was the impression that the crew was rushing and focused for quick completion of the service for getting rest soon...All in all a frustrating experience after a heavy working week, which I don't wish to repeat!","2021-02-02"
"3","Fine in the air, terrible at the airports","CDG-CAI Dec. 25: check-in perfect, security awful: no priority lane, male attendant rude and brutal (we made a complaint at the AF lounge), boarding chaotic, passengers huddled together, no distancing, we had to tell the ground crew to organize lines. Flight was pleasant, steward not so attentive, thinking his own thoughts. Stewardesses very pleasant.

CAI-CDG Jan. 27: check-in horrible. The male attendant was very, very unpleasant though we were the only business class passengers, demanded proof my Swiss WIFE could live in France (!!!!!!!!!), demanded to check and recheck our PCR tests though we saw SEVERAL passengers were allowed to board without a test (we saw them sent to testing facilities when we arrived in CDG--some people are more equal than others). AF should sack their staff in Cairo ASAP. No lines for passport control. Lounge comfortable and quiet--no alcohol--food O.K. Boarding was very easy (88 passengers on a 777-300). The stewardesses were perfect--we were alone in the cabin. Champagne before take-off. No dinner, only breakfast. We landed early, our luggage came when we reached the carrousel.

Ground crews are either incompetent or surly if not dangerous for the health of others- AND health security in Cairo MUST be improved. Passsengers without a PCR test MUST NOT be allowed to board (because the Cairo staff know tests are free in France unlike in Egypt but people who can afford a plane ticket can afford an EGP200 test which is the maximum price for an Egyptian national).

Let me assure you that it felt really very “smooth” to be seated, with my required face-mask, amidst a lot of neighbors with their masks down, eating slowly and talking with each other without any other precautions for at least twenty minutes.

Upon arrival the airport seemed a desolate place, where it is mostly shutdown due to COVID-19, and so you cannot even get to eat except sandwiches at ridiculous prices. They take away any water to force you to buy Evian.
Now, contrary to the efforts above, the flight from Paris was MORE THAN FULL. How can it be? We had a group or mothers with yelling/screaming babies, each of them occupying just 1 seat. It mean that for many 3 people in a row we had actually 4 people!
Great way to deal with Covid situation, don't you think?
On top of that it got very very cold and the promised inflight Wi-Fi didnt exist. Now, the chorus of babies and little children yelled and screamed the entire 11.5 hours non-stop. Not even my Bose headphones with noise cancellation could handle it. Some asked the crew deal with them. Their response was ""What can we do?"". They just don't care. A young french woman next to me said it was the worst flight of her life too.

"5","My experience in Air France flight from Sao Paulo to Bangalore on August 1, 2020","My experience on travelling to India via Air France on Aug 1st 2020 via Paris with 3 hr layover. 
Many of us were including myself doesnt have any idea what to expect travelling during this COVID time apart from Vande bharath Misson.

From August 1st India has opened its international flights with few carriers and Air France was one of them. I had a very pleasant experience both inside the flight as well as in Bangalore airport.
I never expected the orderly and perfect arrangements in Bangalore Airport. Its was properly choreographed. 
I would suggest people to wait for one more week(till 8th Aug) so that they can avoid hotel quarantine.
Here it goes...

1. Flight was from GRU. 
2. MUST TAKE PCR test. 
3. Whatever airfrance asks for documents have it ready printed and filled. The hard copy is very helpful in Paris airport. Once your flight confirms they send you all the required documents. DO NOT SKIP ANY.
4. As of 1 st Aug..  we reached airport 5 hrs before expecting long queues for checks in GRU but there were none and surprisingly the airline counters were open too.
5. All were straight forward. Keep your sanitizers in spray form. It makes life easier. 
6. Using Gloves also a good idea. Get disposable gloves.. 
7. Flight was clean,  food was good.  Served hot. So no need pack food and water. Basic dinner lunch and breakfast is served. My flight was at 15:00 so after we took off, dinner was served and then before we land Breakfast was served. Enough water is provided. Same in Paris to Bangalore lap, 2 meals were served. The food was not elaborate they used to be but enough. 
There was very few people inside the flight, most of us were able to stretch out in other seats :D 
8. Without PCR test result REPORT as negative, you wont be able to allow after 2nd lap. In Paris before on boarding to Bangalore,  they need to see test result. (Printed test paper makes it easier) 
There were people who came without PCR results from USA and they werent allowed to board the flight. They were asking many excuses but denied their entry.
After you enter, they give you couple of documents to fill.. Fill all of them and keep it ready before landing in Bangalore. You need to give them immediately after you land in the airport.
9. Once in Bangalore airport.. every thing is properly organized,  1st your temp is checked,  2nd oximeter check,  3rd PCR test results verified.
10. Hardly in 30 min according to the rush, (i finished in 30 min).. 
head to immigration,  
collected bag,  (Only our flight has arrived at that time and baggage was already in the carousel) 
Clear customs(i wasn't checked for any).
11. Once u exit, u will be given hotel option.. one 5 star and one 3 star. 
12. I took 5 star.. 4100  per day With all 3 meals, and enough drinking water,  clean sanitized room and very polite and cordial people.
13. The hotel guys arrange a local bus to take u to hotel, get settled for 7 DAY MUST QUARANTINE. 
14. All comes to ur room. Food was hot and tasty. Simple veg meals. If u need more u could order. 
All were arranged properly. As I landed in bangalore at mid night I was worried about ferrying taxi..but that was also taken care by the hotel guys.
Another tip is have some Indian cash in hand. You need to pay for the bus(300/-) but if there is no hotel quarantine then its not necessary. You have an ATM before you exit if you need cash.

I really appreciate both the Airlines and also Bangalore Airport arrangements.","2020-08-05"

"1","Avoid at all cost!","Some four months after cancelling our flights, still not refunded my credit card. Do not require a voucher, or alternative flight. However, they have refunded my sister for the same flights, booked at the same time! They trot out the same unhelpful response every time you contact them. They currently are unable to provide details of a UK contact address via their messenger service or on the phone?! Have applied for a charge back on credit card. Next step will be a court claim. 
Would not recommend and will never use again. ","2020-08-02"

"4","Much Better than BA, by miles","Just returned from Munich. Flew with Air France.  Had to Change in Paris on the outward and inward journeys.  Small place with very comfortable seats.  Free coffee.  The flights were smooth and barely a jolt on landing.  Staff very friendly too.  We took hand luggage so had no problems with this.  Staff insisted on customers wearing surgical face masks but for those people who didn't have them staff supplied them free of charge.  Easy to get on board and bus waiting to take us to the terminal once we arrived.  No inflight entertainment available on board but each flight was only an hour or so long, so this was not required.  Would use them again any time.","2020-07-31"
"1","AirFrance withholding my money 4+ months after they cancelled my flight","I have been unsuccessful in obtaining my money back from Air France after they cancelled my flight due to COVID. I completed the online refund request form on March 22nd after they cancelled my flight. They did not get around to responding until May 22nd. It is now July 30th and I have only received emails from them saying they are overwhelmed by COVID and to be patient while they process my request. I have had to file a dispute with my bank and hope they will be able to return my money soon. I would not recommend Air France and do not plan to spend more money with this airline.","2020-07-30"
"1","SCAM AIRLINE - No reimbursement yet for a cancelled flight in April!","Air France has really the worst customer service of all airlines. They lost all respect for their customers and suddenly became a SCAM AIRLINE. How is it possible that no one has the decency of picking up the phone at their customer service numbers? All you hear is a recording, same with emails. Our flights Paris - Palma de Mallorca were cancelled in April and I had no reply to my claim since then. We paid 350 EUR in February for these flights and it is now almost August. I feel scammed by Air France. I wonder how this airline can be France's national airline? It's truly an embarrassment.   Up until today, no refund, no information, no reimbursement even though we are theoretically protected by European consumer laws - they clearly do not care about these laws. Customers come last for Air France. You deserve to go bankrupt. DO NOT BUY TICKETS WITH AIR FRANCE EVER AGAIN.","2020-07-24"
"1","Stealing money on luggages","They are stealing people and charge 45 euros if your cabin luggage and your handbag exceed 12 kg in total even just one kilo. Never saw this before even with low costs companies. You shouldn't take cabin luggages with Air-France .","2020-07-21"
"5","Excellent Service","I booked my mother on a repatriation fight from Johannesburg to Glasgow on 11th July and as an 81 year old with knee and hip problems I booked her wheel chair assistance. I do not think it would have been possible for any Air Line to treat her any better or look after her as well as Air France did.

From the minute she arrived at the assembly point in Sandton, South Africa they had a wheel chair waiting for her and someone to help with her luggage and onto the bus. When arriving at the airport the had a wheel chair waiting and once again someone to help with her luggage. They assisted her the whole way (checkin, weighing luggage, taking luggage to collection point, through customs, departure lounge and the up to the door of the aircraft and to her seat).

The service on the trip from Johannesburg to Pairs was outstanding. On arrival in Paris she was helped off the plane to the waiting wheelchair at the door of the plane and taken straight to the business class lounge (without her even having to ask) as she had a 4 hour layover. The constantly checked up on her to make sure she was alright and to reassure her that they had not forgotten her. Once again took her to the plane when it was time to leave.

This was notbthe case with KLM as the gelp was so bad she even had to ask othe passengers to help with her carry on luggage.

Well done Air France we as a family will be using your services in the future.","2020-07-18"
"1","HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!!!","Well I traveled to Paris from Athens for 2 days well all good through security check and then we boarded we had the middle sit empty all good ..  and there we go the bad experience starts ... some people weren't wearing their masks properly with their nose out and some weren't wearing it at all .. and the aircraft was doing absolutely nothing about it they didnt care about our safety at all.

And then my return yesterday 15/07/2010 from paris to athens arrival time 6:50pm flight number AF1332

And again inside plane safety was the same people with no masks and flight attendants was doing nothing about it ... 
And anyway 
We arrive at the airport and the police is there waiting for the arrivals and they start asking if we have the QR codes and we had no clue what they talking about they put us on a corner and then explained that there's a new greek law that says u have to fill a form before u enter the country otherwise u get a fine of 500€

They kept us at the airport till 10pm and the police was saying the airline representatives have to come it's their responsibility for what happened cause they didnt let you all know that u had to fill that form ... and at the beginning they were saying the airline has to take us back to paris and then they started saying we'll pay the fine of 500€ .. and after hours of waiting they decided to let us go and get tested and not pay anything this time.

We all were ready to sue the company if we had to pay for something we didnt know

"1","Refused to refund when air France cancelled my reservation","I booked 5 airline reservations with Farboom on 09/19/2019 to fly Air France on June 28th 2020. The airline cancelled our reservation and changed it to July 1st. Then they cancelled again and scheduled it for July 12th. I finally had enough of them deciding for me when to travel. The country that I was going to would not open the air traffic until July 14th. In addition, the country would not allow any airline to land in it's airports except the domestic airline. The airline I was traveling with, would not be able to fly us there. I contacted Fairboom many times to refund me the money, they want to charge me $75 for every passanger. I refuse to loose $375 for a cancellation that I didn't initiate. The airline is the one that cancelled my original tickets, not me. They didn't honor their commitment to fly us on the date that we chose. I know that I am entitled to a full refund without any question!
I am going to give them one more chance for them to make right and refund me the money. I used Fairboom for many years. I travel with my family every two years and bring my mother once a year. In addition to anyone coming to visit me, I purchase their tickets with Fairboom. I am also a board member of a large community which I always recommend Fairboom for all member's travel needs.
My order number is O-2B933577 and I would like my full refund!

Umm... the legroom in economy is cramped and less than the comparable space on SWISS. 

... also- there is not in-flight entertainment through the aircraft: the airline sends the economy passengers links to magazines and entertainment and these can only be activated once on the aircraft. ","2020-07-12"

"1","Worst experience EVER","First time I traveled with this airline and for sure it would be the last. At the check in was a rude employee how kept talking to me only in French and he wanted to charge me 280$ for each  of my suitcase because it was 1.5 kilos more.... I literally started to cry trying to find a garbage can to throw away my stuff when a very kind LAX employee brought me a carbon box. ( all the stores were closed due to Covid so no place to buy a suitcase). Then on the aircraft my chair was broken. The nightmare continued. We landed 11.45 when we exit the airplane it was 12.25  (40 minutes after) . And then another 50 minutes standing  in line to pass the checking point to get my connecting flight. 70% of the  announcements were only in French in the airport and during the flight. And finally one of my suitcases for which I paid the  280$ didn’t arrive. The sad thing is that I have a return ticket. 
Never travel with them....!!!!!","2020-06-20"
"1","VERY BAD SERVICE","PROBLEM
My flight was partially cancelled by the airline company. 
No option to get cashback for the whole flight.
No alternative proposed by the airline company.

CONTEXT
Back and forth flight for 2 persons from KBP to NTE for 27/07/2020.
Reservation was done directly through the site airfrance.fr.
Flight is served by Air France and KLM.

SOLUTION (not solved)
Search in Internet and on Air France site for solution: no solution.
Search in Internet and on Air France site for e-mail or other digital communication service: no solution.
Call Air France FRENCH support - after 40 minutes I got a person answered in ENGLISH, which redirected me on other phone line.
After 40 minutes on the other hone line the call is ended with no answer.
Next day after 1 hour I got an answer that I should contact KLM service support for my problem (which I find not logic because I did my reservation through Air France).
After 1 hour on phone I finally got in contact with KLM. They told that I should call another country KLM customer support. (my current mobile phone plan will cost me around 3 EUR/min for this country => 180 EUR/h)
As alternative, I contacted all other communication services of KLM (WhatsApp, Messenger, Twitter) with explanation of my problem.
Yet, not solution…

CONCLUSION
In total I spent around 6 hours on this issue, while, probably, I would still need to spend hours more to solve the issue. In addition, call cost to another country.
These all are beyond the price of ticket I got.

Who will pay back the hours I spent with useless customer support to solve THEIR problem?
I would suggest the least they could propose in such a case – to give higher class of flight, or free of charge service or at least something…","2020-06-16"
"1","Very poor customer service","After Air France cancelled one of the two connection flights booked via the Air France website it was impossible to contact the service center. It’s understandable in these times that cancellations happen, however, Air France never offered a reasonable alternative and the ones that were offered included high service fees for changing the flights. After one week of unsuccessfully trying to contact Air France I cancelled the whole booking due to lack of support. I booked new flights with another more reliable airline who offer quick and helpful responses.","2020-06-16"
"1","Overall visit","I'll never book my ticket through air France again and not recommend to anyone staff and Hosttes not caring meal is the wrost and when ask for hot beverage takes forever to bring language barrier as well had a bad experience while on vacation with family that's why I book my return with different airline.","2020-03-12"
"1","total discrimination","My flight was late for more than 5 hours. I applied for refund, 6 days after my friend who was in the same airplane as I was. Since she is from UK she was given 600 euros about 3 months ago. I still received nothing, since I am from Serbia. What other explanation I can have? total discrimination by nationality. During the flight a woman passenger was complaining about the behavior of another France passenger. And stuff did nothing to solve situation. The woman was mad and she was shouting that Air France favorize France passengers and that it is discrimination and that she had experienced that before with this company. I did not understand than what she was talking about, but now I know very well. Obviously, discrimination is in the air with this company, weather they prefer France nation or EU nations, but those out of their interest are not welcomen. Although they pay the same price for a ticket!. So pay attention to this company.","2020-03-11"
"5","Valentine's Day Champagne Treat","As we were checking in we were invited to use the First Class lounge!  It was Valentine's Day.  We sipped champagne and stretched out in luxury while we were waiting for our flight.  We had upgraded our seats and there was plenty of space to stretch out on the international flight.  The small three hour hop from Paris to Morocco was the same cramped three seats across, but service, on board, at the gate and at the desk,  as always was impeccable.","2020-03-11"
"3","The airline has lowered the level of attention and food","The airline has lowered the level of attention and food above all, 4 years ago it was very different, has decided to massify questionnaires to give a better price but lost quality.","2020-03-11"
"4","Air France","Good flight, except for the return from Paris when I was on the Kenya airways flight. Filight was hot and uncomfortable, and they would would not let you change your seat to the empty ones (although I did try online when checking in on the Air France site). The funny thing was, plenty of people changed their seat without asking and they got away with it!","2020-03-11"
"2","Not the Air France you are used to","Air France uses a Caribbean version of their B777-300 for this route. The aircraft is very old, seats are cramped (mostly if the passenger sitting in front of you declines the seatback.....we even paid for some extra room in a couple of ""love seats""), seatback screen is very small and pixeled, inflight film selection is rather poor and made mostly for French nationals, inflight menu is difficult to navigate, onboard meals are rather tasteless.

So why did we choose flight route?. Simply out of convenience as it was the only non-stop between Paris and Cancun and we paid a premium price for it. 

All in all, if you have got an alternative, I would seriously look into it and ponder whether you may be better off by choosing it over these very old Air France aircrafts.","2020-03-11"

All I can say is that Air France Cabin Crew long haul have a very easy job compared to all of the other airlines that I have flown with, hardly saw them through the whole of the flight, will not be flying with Air France again. Very disappointing, wish I had gone with Emirates via Dubai !!  The flight from manchester to CDG was however very pleasant crew very pleasant and helpful","2020-03-11"
"3","Too Hot","My experience on this flight was the cabin was hot the entire time. I had no option to add air in my seat(over head blower) and so the fight was uncomfortable.

Staff was very patient and accommodating. The flight left, and arrived, on-time. 2 meals that were decent (for airplane food).
**Recommendation: I paid the extra charge to use the Air France Lounge in both Toronto and Paris. As expected, the assortment of food and drink more than paid for what we probably would have spent in any of the restaurants or bars at the airport while waiting for our flight.

"1","Do not book with Air France","My boyfriend and I flew from Paris to London. We had a carry on and a backpack  and at security they asked us to weigh all our belongings together, which needed to be 25lbs and under. We travel often and we never had to experience this. He asked me to check in just my luggage, which I did happily. This took us an extra 20 min as the credit card machines where down. When returning, he then asked us to reweigh my boyfriends luggage and asked for him to checkin his, which made us miss our flight. When working our way back to the checkin counter, the attendant was not helpful at all. We ended up booking on our own. When arriving at London, we went to track down my luggage and it was not in the system. I wanted to file a claim and no one from Air France wanted to help me. When I flew back to LAX, I had to file a claim with British Airways, as Air France in both London and LA didn't want to assist. 

Overall, I would never fly Air France again. The worst service I ever experience. They charge $50.00 to check in a luggage that ended up being lost.","2020-02-28"
"5","Maintaining Air France gold status has its benefits","I stick with Air France because they stick with me. Because I have Gold status, I get to go to the lounge and bring my flying companion.

"2","Air France airport staff were not helpful. Need better and more consistent communication/information sharing with passen","I have just returned from an international trip with Air France and found their communications woefully inadequate. When one member of our 46 person travel group lost her passport at the Charles De Gaulle Airport (CDG) in Paris their Customer Service reps made a call and told us they had found it and it would be brought to their desk. After waiting for a while they said it would be with our Gate Agent where we were waiting to board. The Gate Agent said they knew about it. After three attempts over the next 2 hours back and forth from Customer Service to Gate Agent, a supervisor told me there was a mistake. She said no one had asked for a lost passport by name (not accurate) and they had found another lost passport so they thought the search was over. Very confusing and not helpful.

On our return we arrived just before 5:00 AM from Tel Aviv at CDG with a connecting flight to Atlanta scheduled for 10:35 departure. About 8 AM someone noticed on the board at our gate that there was a gate change (from M50 to M27). At 8:18 I received an email notification that the scheduled time of our departure had been changed to 12:00. Shortly after we arrived at M27 we noticed on the board that we were now moved to M23. Not long after arriving at that gate another board announcement said we were moved to M49- at the other end of a VERY long concourse just across from our original gate M50. 

12:00 noon was supposed to be our new departure time. At about 10 minutes after noon there was an announcement that we would begin boarding soon. This was the FIRST announcement of any kind made to inform passengers of what was going on. We were not told that we would not board the plane at the gate but after lining up to board the flight we were loaded on buses and transported completely across that vast airport to a waiting flight with only external stairs to enter the plane. Finally at 12:45 the flight started it take-off.

Not until the plane was fully loaded was any announcement explaining or apologizing for the delay.

If it was a mechanical issue, there is nothing that could be done about it but the lack of information increased everyone's anxiety and irritation. Surely this situation could have been handled better.","2020-02-27"
"2","Why pay for Business Class?","What is the point of flying Business Class on a 737-800 when there is no more room for seating in Business Class than coach?  The seat arrangement is 3 seats on one side and 3 on the other. the accommodation is that no one will sit in the middle seat.  the flight leaves at 01:40 in the morning and arrives at 06:00. Forget about sleeping.  Find another airline, or save your money with a coach ticket.","2020-02-27"
"3","What happened to airline companies ? ","I don’t understand what happened to airline companies ? 

Why are every single one of them getting cheaper and cheaper as the years go by ? 

I have flown Air France a few times in the past years and honestly it has started to decline so much lately with the struggle to keep up with this cheap travel that young people are doing nowadays. 

Dear Air France,

If you believe in yourself, keep your service good and keep your prices normal and trust me people will fly. We want to fly to the most magical city in the world on the most magical airline in the world. We DO NOT want to fly to the most magical city in the world on that nasty thing you call an airline. 

Get back to the days of two proper meals, and good service. Also please serve real champagne on your plane. Not that cheap California wine you call champagne. You are French you should know better. 

Definitely a don’t fly with them until they fix things kind of situation. ","2020-02-26"

Call center never available (waiting times of 25 minutes and then phones hangs up)

"3","Seat room was ridiculously tight for a transatlantic flight","We flew on a shared Delta Airlines / Air France route from Edinburgh to Paris CDG, through transit to Toronto. Nice airplane, good food, etc. and on the way back, the pilot advised us that our plane was brand new, only 2 months old.

That's all wonderful, but when the seats are so tightly packed together, it makes for a very uncomfortable flight. I personally feel airlines shouldn't be allowed to operate long-distance flights with this legroom. And yes, 6 hours is a long distance when seats are packed so closely together.

Also, on the return flight, we had one lovely stewardess and one not-so-nice. I suffer from IBS and had a sudden attack, just after dinner when we still had the food trays on the tables. I struggled to stand up, trying to juggle my tray and put my table up, even though I had an aisle seat. Then, when I got to the back of the plane, I couldn't see the toilets. On this new plane, they were situated right at the back, not on the sides where I expected them to be. By this time, I was desperate and asked the stewardess who was in a central kitchen where the toilets were and she snapped at me, Just round there. I still couldn't see them because she didn't add that they were flush with the back of the plane, not off the aisle as they usually area.

I had to ask her a second time and she wasn't any more helpful, but I did eventually manage to find them, no thanks to her.

Originally, I was really pleased to see that we were on Delta / Air France, believing in the standards of comfort that these two big airlines used to offer, but not any more.","2020-02-26"
"1","Embarrassingly Poor Customer Service and Baggage Handling","First they lost my bag, made me wait 2 hrs to file a claim at the airport (ended up leaving the airport at 3am). Next day they called me to say they found it and that it’s on the way... only to be told the next day it’s been lost yet again and they have no idea where it is. The next day they tell me it’s made it from Boston to Paris, they’re not sure how it’s going to get to India. I’m not going to be in Delhi for much longer, by the time they get my bag to India the trip will be done and I will be in the US. Unbelievably unreceptive customer service, no one is able to give a legitimate understanding of what the plan for the bag is and what is occurring, and everyone is happy to pass blame on what’s the cause and to delay till the next day. Terrible service, have heard similar horror stories from friends after sharing my experience. Save yourself the trouble unless all your bags are disposable.","2020-02-26"

"2","Changed my flight times AGAIN","air france have for the second time in as many trips cancelled my early arrival into Accra Ghana. A flight that was supposed to arrive into Ghana at 17:45 now arrives at 21:40. They didn't even have the decency to move the outward flight from the original 9:00am departure, so as to minimize our waiting time.

So to recap, their proposal is leave 09:00 to arrive at 21:40. For a flight to Ghana. Not Hong Kong, Ghana which is around 6 hours away.

So their depriving me of one whole day in effect.

Second time in a row this has occurred to me when flying air france.

I will NEVER choose this carrier again.","2020-02-26"

They were so stingy with their offerings it was if the cost was coming out of their pockets.  The food was awful - the food was left in plastic for the customer to unwrap and provided wooden flatware, a piece of fabric was your napkin, and everything was in plastic.  The staff should have stood at the front of the plane and thrown a bag lunch at you as you were taking your seat.  I thought Southwest or some of the other US discount airlines were bad - Air France made these discount airlines look like luxury.  Air France brochures touted their top rate chefs that prepared their food for flights but it was no better than something plucked from your freezer section and microwaved.  I had high hopes for this airline---but they were a total letdown.  Save your money and spend a little more to upgrade to an airline that actually cares about it customers.","2020-02-24"

"3","Decent flight","We flew with Air France from Paris to Manchester, this is a relatively short flight but we arrived in Manchester about 20 minutes before the ETA which was great. 
The aircraft was clean and service was good.
The only downside was the food they served. Passengers received a snack which was a cheese sandwich with some cajun mayo in it (which was the only thing they had). The bread was very dry and they didnt have anything else on offer for young children.
So if you are flying with them, I would recommend you bring your own food.","2020-02-24"
"1","They didn't care","If you suffer from a food allegy, this airline just doesn't care. We very carefully booked gluten free meals for my husband who is a very reactive coeliac but no food was available and the crew denied it haad been booked. They very ungraceously deigned to look for snacks and virtually threw them at him - so rude! We were allowed to lodge a complaint but told we probably wouldn't hear anything. We did but the airline said meals werre not part of their contract but a concession to travellers.","2020-02-24"
"5","All good flights.","First time on Air France. Took 3 flights. Food really good. Service excellent with a smile. Always there to help.  The movies and music some of the best I have seen. Seats close together but like all the economy seats. On time leaving and arriving. Will definitely fly with them again to Africa and Europe. Up to now the very best flights I have had.","2020-02-24"
"3","Not the most comfortable A380 experience","This is not the most comfortable configuration of the A380 - sears do not fully decline and the reduced comfort is not conducive to a good nights sleep. 
The food offering is no more than reasonable- does not compare with the offering from Qatar Airways for example. 
Service was good - despite some bickering between crew members audible to passengers - certain crew members went beyond the normal level. 
All things considered I would look for an alternative carrier to do this trip in the future.","2020-01-30"
"2","Good onboard entertainment, good punctuality; nothing else","To say that France is meant to be the culinary capital of the world, the food was awful. Dinner was a dreadful pasta dish that I took one bite of and left, there was an inedible crumble desert, the only highlight was the plastic cup of water that I was given and breakfast was an uneatable pastry which was greasy, full of stringy cheese that practically chokes you when you eat it and rock hard fruit to follow.  The tea that they served was cold and as weak as water, and the bread roll was a hideous sweet doughy mass.

The entertainment was good, with a fine selection of recent films, classics and TV shows in various languages.  Also games and I always find it fun to follow the flight on that map of the world.. However if you want a decent viewing experience try to avoid travelling cattle class (sorry I mean economy).  The seats are way too close together both in front of you and the person at your side.  If you have one of those annoying people in front of you who insists on leaning their chair as far back as physically possible then its virtually impossible to watch a movie as the screens do not rotate to allow for the angle of the tilt of the chair in front of you.  I had to politely ask the woman in front of me to move forward as I was unable to watch my film.  The woman at the side kept digging in me as she desperately tried to find a position of comfort in which to sleep. Might I add I struggled with that too.

The air con is way too much.  I spent the flight practically freezing my pants off with only a wafer thin blanket that they offered to provide you with any thermal protection.

During the quieter times of the night they did leave water,coke etc at key strategic points so that if you felt thirsty during the flight you could help yourself. A fairly international mix of crew and passengers.  The fight took off on time and arrived at Paris again on time and in all fairness a relatively smooth journey","2020-01-29"
"1","Extremely non-flexible flight change policy","Horrible flight change policy. Even with the coronavirus, they only offer ""credits refund"" for flights directly flying into Wuhan. Which basically means ""no credit refund"" as no one would be flying into Wuhan at this point + the city is shut down. A $300 flight change fee is extremely unnecessary, simply for them to gain 80%+ profit margin. Bad and non-flexible service.","2020-01-28"
"4","LONG-HAUL TO INDIA","I still find the AF Premium Economy seats a bit clunky in the way they recline, and it's still stunning to me that there's no USB port to be found...just one AC outlet per passenger.  The 787 lighting and cabin are very nice, the 777-300 a little more dated, but fine.  Service is usually excellent, and the various snacks they leave out for us to graze on are appreciated. CDG transfers seem to be better organized in the past...but maybe I'm just jaded!","2020-01-28"

"2","Airbus A380 from Johannesburg - crew only allowed to fly this plane twice a week!!","I developed an eye problem during the flight which is now being treated in the UK - it is likely that this problem was caused by a bad environment on the plane, cabin pressure problems etc.
This bad environment was confirmed to me by a member of the crew, when I mentioned my eye problem, who told me that crew were only allowed to fly two trips per week on this particular aircraft due to a potential cumulative affect of the bad environment (my guess is also possible contamination of the air conditioning system from the engines - more common than you may think but a problem not widely talked about!).","2020-01-28"
"2","Abandoned at Charles De Gaulle","My wife and I were notified during our stay in SA that there were industrial troubles expected on our return, we therefore checked before departure and were told that the AF system was still showing our connecting flight was expected to operate.  Wrong. We arrived at CDG in the early hours of the morning to be told our connection was cancelled and that we would have to wait 11 hours in the terminal, despite there being two earlier flights that we could have been put on.  All was okay though because they gave us €26.00! (have you ever tried to buy food in an airport) each to feed ourselves with.  If you want customer service, choose another airline.","2020-01-27"
"5","Good service, complicated checkin","Great service in the plane, with option to book fast internet connection which allowed me to work while in flight. The only downside were during checkin. The person who attend us didn't want to deliver a boarding pass to my girlfriend because he didn't believe she had a resident permit in Europe, he kept watching videos on YouTube and translating the document on the internet (for half an hour!). Shouldn't be that a concern for the police instead? Apart from the strange situation, all good.","2020-01-27"
"5","Excellent Service on my First Air France flight","This year I decided not to go to Paris for a night and take the TGV, but to fly after arriving at CDG from Toronto, to take an Air France flight to Nice. I booked ahead and qualified that my small dog would be allowed in the cabin. You are confirmed that there is space for your pet, but you must check in before boarding to let AF check your pet’s papers and pay 40 euros for the one way trip. I had my bag checked and when an attendant saw that this was my first time, escorted me to the place where my pet’s papers were check and where I would pay the fee,  Then she escorted me back to the checkin for boarding and made certain there were no issues before wishing me a good flight. The 1.5 hour flight was excellent - clean, good service etc and it was wonderful to get my baggage, leave the airport and hop on the new tram service into Nice. This is now how I will connect to Nice in the future.","2020-01-25"

You even get a free coffee and a croissant again not like thief Ryan air they charge you for the tea coffee and you get free 12kg luggage again not like thief Ryanair they charge £25 for each small luggage.

We complete the forms with the delivery address in Witbank. i recieved confirmation from Air France that our luggage is on the next flight. I was informed that the luggage arrived at ORT.

"1","Lost Baggage and Nobody taking Responsibility","Worst travel experience ever, and I have traveled A LOT. First time using Air France, and am very disappointed with their service. I am open to using various airlines, and was open to using Air France in the future, but never again. Air France joins my list of AA and United as never again airlines.

The flight was fine. However, the aftermath of this seemingly innocent flight has been a horrible experience. I believe they use Pacific Atlantic Handling (PAH) for their baggage related issues, but nobody seems to want to take responsibility for the lost bags. I asked the agent at PAH who takes responsibility for baggage issues, and says I could TRY Air France, so here I am. (will also be filing a complaint)

My two carry on bags were taken from me at the gate at Malaga because the flight was full. We were assured that they would make it to NY, and that we would just need to pick it up there. Well, surprise, the bags never made it. I had a trip the very next day, and needed my luggage asap. They assured me they would find it, and forward it to my next destination. It all seemed well and dandy when I received a message that they had found my bags the next day.

The bags never arrived. 

We checked every day we were at the next destination, and finally got a response that they did not know where my bags were. We went to check if the bags were at the airport, but lo and behold absolutely no open airline offices. I have returned to NY, and just checked. Again, they don't know where the bags are. However, they let me know the identification tags have been switched probably by Air France themselves for the expedited flight. That's nice to know NOW, but maybe this should've been shared when they actually expedited the bags. 

I asked if I will be getting updates on the bags, and received a No. The only update I will receive is when (aka IF) they make it to NY. I asked them to send photos of the bags when they find it, but that's impossible I was told. I also asked who takes responsibility, and PAH agent says probably Air France. Well, great to know nobody knows where anything is, and nobody is checking where anything is.","2020-01-22"
"3","Horrible hassle to change Airport CDG-ORY for connection flights","We will NEVER again book a flight with AF where we have to change the airport from CDG (International airport) to ORY (National airport). It was a nerve-racking hassle.
First you need to secure a place in LeBusDirect (the bus has 55 seats, so you can count the queue to check if you will make it in). At CDG you could not queue, people were standing in a swarm around the bus doors. To get from CDG to ORY took over 2 hours, because the traffic was so bad (was around noon on a Wednesday). The only reason we made in time for our flight to FDF (we had 4 hours 15 minutes for changing airports) was that we had Business Class tickets and could skip the queues in ORY for check-in and security (security fast lane was chaotic). Business Class was nice and seating was 1-2-1.The business class seating from FDF to ORY was 2-3 (!!!)-2 and the plane was very old, especially the TV screens. 
On our way back we waited a very long time for our luggage at Orly Airport (make sure that they put the priority stickers on you luggage at FDF airport). At ORY there was a orderly queue for LeBusDirect albeit very long and we just made it in. Traffic to CDG was also very bad.
Please note:
 I wrote to AF regarding LeBusDirect and they basically wrote me that if you take LeBusDirect and you miss your connecting flight (the flights have to be on one ticket, e.g. MUC-FDF) it is the fault of AF and they have to book you on another flight.
If you take a taxi / uber and miss your connecting flight it is your fault.
Vouchers for LeBusDirect if you fly from Munich:
We did not get our vouchers at Munich Airport and had to ask for them at an AirFrance desk at CDG. BUT people we met who flew from MUC - FDF in Economy Class got the vouchers at check-in in Munich. So ask for a supervisor if they do not give you the LeBusDirect vouchers at check-in Munich.","2020-01-22"

File C-2924974
Flights Brest> Hong Kong
2 long-time Flying Blue passengers (2110495924 & Gold 1542682454)

Hello, I would like to report a huge lack of professionalism from airfrance. During the registration, my arrival but also during the processing of my complaint file.
We traveled the night of the 31st Jan from Brest to Hong Kong via Paris and this entirely on AirFrance.

1) During the check-in, the operator forced us to pay 100E of excess baggage without negotiation while our booking was as follows:
- Brest Paris (Charles B 1 Bag / Joyce C 1 bag + 1gold)
Total 3 pieces of luggage
- Paris HongKong (Charles B 2 bags / Joyce C 0 baggage + 1gold)
Total 3 pieces of luggage
So we did have 3 pieces of luggage for the entire trip.

2) This same operator forced us to transfer 2kg of clothing from one suitcase to another when one piece of luggage was only 10kg (We were therefore below the total allowance of 69kg (3 * 23kg) and no suitcase exceeded 30kg, maximum weight for a standard suitcase authorized by civil aviation).
Lack of professionalism and flexibility evident because she was alone and therefore the queue was growing behind us.

3) This same operator refused to put my spouse and myself side by side on the plane because we were traveling in a different category (gold vs explorer). Even when we told her that we could both be in the ""subcategory"". She did not try to find a solution because she did not even pretend to look at her screen.

4) Obviously all this with a total lack of friendliness. Not a smile not the slightest attempt at an arrangement to satisfy loyal travelers and this on New Year's Eve ... In short, Low Cost airlines do better and international competition is fierce, this is not a strategy to follow to continue .

5) My luggage was lost on arrival at HK. Luggage has since been found so nothing too serious.

6) So I opened a complaint file. And there, very ""malicious"" treatment on the part of AirFrance, because they do everything to discourage you from insisting on your request.
The person I had in contact had the following signature:
F. ................. S
Your Air France KLM Customer Service Assistant
Phone. : 09 69 39 36 54 (choice 4)
When you call this number, an operator answers to tell you that the only way to have your contact on the phone is to ask them by email to call you back. What I did and the email response I received was that this person could not respond to my request and therefore considered my file CLOSED. Unacceptable! Customer requests are therefore not even listened to!

I have received miles and a credit of 100E at expiration.
But that does not excuse the error of AirFrance nor the lack of professionalism of several services (check-in, logistics, and after-sales service) you wrongly billed me for 100E and I therefore want to be reimbursed for this amount on the credit card used for this payment.

I would think very strongly about the next company I would use on my next trips. I enjoy flying with Airfrance because I am French but I must recognize that Cathay Pacific (the Hong Kong company where I live does a much better job in terms of service, punctuality, flexibility and friendliness).

Kind regards,

Charles B","2020-01-22"
"1","Mrs","Very disappointed.
My first flight arrives late and I had to run to even catch my plane, other people missed theirs and I could hear them complaining.
The flight was ok, very friendly staff, but the food was not nice at all. When I arrived in Cape Town it turned out that my baggage had been left behind in Paris. I was told by airport staff that I would not get compensated for anything I needed to buy. My baggage was brought to me 3 days after I landed and it had been emptied out. Most of my things had been stolen, and what was left was broken into pieces. Now I have been trying to get in touch with Air France and no one is answering. I am so mad now, this is not going to go unheard! Will never ever fly with them again, bitterly disappointed and horrific treatment of customers in combination with very expensive flights!","2020-01-21"

"1","Terrible, frustrating, and traumatic, travek experience","I will never fly Air France (or Delta again).  
In summary, an Air France emoloyee was extremely rude to me.  When I responded in kind, Air France denied me bording (stranding me in Paris) and then extortionately demanded that a pay for a new full fare ticket to return home on the next available flight. 

The issue began when a horrendously rude check in agent charged me a 45 Euro overweight bag fee for a bag that I had flown to Paris with on Air France days earlier, which had not changed in weight, and for which I was previously not charged a fee. When I challenged her about the fee she was extremely rude and unprofessional.  I asked for her name so that I could mention it in a customer service complaint and she immediately hid her name tag and refused to provide a name.   I snapped a picture of her instead (to include it in the complaint) and she then refused to issue me my boarding pass, demanding that I delete the photo before she would give me the pass.  After about five minutes of back and forth arguing she finally relented and gave me the boarding pass.  As I turned to leave, she sarcastically wished me a happy flight which led to a mutual exchange of expletives between us.  I then left the counter and proceeded through security and waited about an hour to board the flight.  However, when it came time to board the plane, Air France gate agents intercepted me and told me that I was being denied boarding because I was ""rude"" to the check in agent and ""needed to learn a lesson."" 

Air France immediately offered to book me on a later flight but only if I was willing to pay more than 600 Euros for a new ticket ... which I refused to pay. When I asked the ticket agent how I was supposed to fly home he laughed at me and told me it was ""my problem to figure out."" 

I ended up having to book a one way flight home with another airline which increased my total travel costs by several hundred Euros.  

Terrible service from an airline with truly miserable employees","2020-01-20"

On top of everything, they use terminal 2G at CDG airport which is a new one and has no crowds at all, comparing to a mess in other terminals.","2020-01-05"
"2","Good flight but delayed baggage","Aircraft was an Airbus A330-200, first class was not offered. The business class seat/space is adequate but offers very little privacy. WiFi was supposedly available on the flight but I was not able to access, tried multiple times.  Cabin crew were very good and meal was one of the best business class meals I have had; great salad and foie gras starters followed by grilled salmon for the main course with strawberry ice cream desert.  Flight was on time but waited at baggage carousel for 50 minutes for baggage.","2020-01-04"
"1","Lack of consideration by Air France for a cancer patient and blatant discrimination","I am a stage IV lung cancer patient with metastasis to my liver. It’s pretty serious but I carry on with my life and dreams.
My return flight to Costa Rica was delayed more than 5 hours at Charles de Gaule Airport. I asked an AF representative if they could put me up at a hotel so that I could lie down and rest. They said no. I asked if there was a lounge where I could comfortably lie down. They sent me to the airport emergency room, where the personnel said I could not lie down there. AF also gave me a €15 credit for food. 
I was confused because I thought AF was trying to hep me, where in fact they were simply trying to get rid of me (a nuisance).
I find this lack of concern very typical of French agencies and civil servants. God forbid I had anything more severe!
I do not recommend Air France at all. They Dutch partners (KLM) are better. But avoid AF unless you want to be surprised in a negative way.
Strangely enough, during the flight a French passenger had a stomachache ache. A Costa Rican doctor onboard, whom I know well for his professionalism, attended him. What surprised me was how the French flight attendants went out of their way to bend the rules and help this guy. They allowed him to lie on the floor even through turbulence, where normally the passenger would have to go back to his seat. He got to sleep on the floor for 3 hours!
This is a classic example of discrimination where they help a French citizen but denied helping me, whose diagnosis was much more serious than this French guy.","2020-01-04"
"2","C'mon! You can do a lot better!  No wifi, substandard food, and crappy service","Now I remember why I haven't flown Air France for a number of years. As an international airline, this is one of the worst. I flew 5 international legs with Air France over a 6-week period. I only did so to boost my Delta miles balance and so that I don't lose the existing miles because I haven't flown Delta in a while. Delta was the carrier when booking but Air France was the service provider. With the experiences I had with Air France, in retrospect I prefer to have forfeited my Delta balance. Air France is truly horrible!

This flight was a 777. The other legs were either 777 or Airbus 320. All with a minimum of 5 hours flight time and a max of 10 hours. When you are stuck on a plane for that long, you expect to get wifi.  Nope.  Not with Air France. I really got tired with the flight attendants BS'ing me that wifi is ""not available today.""  Well, when will it be available?  Seriously, I asked that question on my most recent trans-Atlantic flight. Finally a FA was honest enough to tell me what was going on. She said there was a ""security"" issue (I think she meant to say ""safety"") in that overuse of the wifi would cause the wiring to catch fire. WHAT?!? I don't think she relayed it correctly in English so I asked her to repeat that in French because I don't see how any wiring catches on fire with wifi use. Airplane wifi is accessed via satellites and an on-board router. Is she telling me the router catches fire? The more I tried to explain it to her the more I got a glazed look and she was thoroughly not understanding anything. She then tried to explain the planes are old and until they retire the 777 and 380 fleet there will be no wifi. I asked how long this has been a problem and she said ""early summer.""  I didn't ask but I assume there is wifi for first class passengers. I told her she should probably just go back to telling people there's no wifi and not try to explain why because it's not a good reflection on Air France (along with all their other drawbacks). 

So, after having drafted a couple of dozen emails and getting in a few hours work, I resigned to the fact that I won't be online until I land and will wait until the airport to send anything. However, wifi wasn't the only problem. There were USB outlets on the seat backs but they had no juice. TIP:  take an extra charged battery or two if your iPhone is running low. Your iPhone, iPad, laptop are the only devices from which to get anything done (without wifi) and your only source of entertainment (unless you still travel with heavy books). 

This leads me to the next issue - no seat back entertainment on the non-trans-Atlantic flights. Yep, stuck on a 5+ hour flight with nothing to watch since there is no screen. I was annoyed at Air France (for having high expectations - thinking they were operating in the 21st century like other international airlines) and myself for not having downloaded enough movies and podcasts since my last flight which was 10 hours. 

I was hoping my meals would compensate for the lack of wifi, entertainment, and customer service. Nope, they were really gross. Where was the French food that the French so often boast about?  The attached photo is of eggs and sausage. The caption (cat puke and 2 fingers) is what it looked like when I first unveiled the foil. The before landing snack was not much better - sandwich that was 95% thick bread with a slice of turkey (or was that ham?).  So, maybe the wine can make up for it.  Nope, one taste of the red and I was done. 

Unless I am forced to, I do not see myself flying Air France again. I mentioned why I did. Most of my destinations are serviced by other carriers.  The trick is making sure that who I book with is the actual service provider. 

If Air France wants to compete in the global market and earn customers who are not first class passengers, they need to do a lot more and look into why other international airlines are ranked higher in customer satisfaction.

"1","Rubbish service and left our bags ","We got 2 connecting flights from Manchester to lima via paris. All stewards except one (who was really lovely) were either indifferent and unfriendly or just plain rude. The (French speaking) women in front of us got wine almost immediately, and I wasn't able to get a water - they ignored my polite gestures/waving to get their attention, and didn't even blink at the call sign. We only had one round of water or drinks on about a 12.5 hour flight in addition to the 2 food rounds. When they brought round small ice creams they ran out and just rudely tipped the box upside down to indicate they were gone... No smiles, no communication pretty much throughout the whole flight. The stewards were nowhere to be seen and resented giving you anything - a self service approach to any water in the galley. The plane itself was old and tired, with a poor selection of films. To top it off, they left our luggage in Paris, and we didn't get it back till 21:20 the next day (which we had to travel back to the airport for) - we were on a treck and all our stuff was in the suitcase so had to buy several new items of kit as we were only told 'maybe' they would arrive. We did get some reimbursement for this when we returned, but even the website to upload your receipts wasn't working well.","2020-01-03"
"1","Horrible, Nasty, Vicious ground crew at Casablanca, Morocco","We flew Air France From Casablanca to Paris and then Paris to Washington DC on December 26th. The Air France crew and the flight were GREAT! The ground crew in Casablanca were nasty, horrible, vicious, and rude.
Shift supervisor (may be name Salma) is vindictive, developed some personal agenda against me and my family. Followed us all the way to the to the plane and told flight attendant to keep an eye on us ( this is what flight attendant told me later as I deplane in Paris). Among ground crew male crew were polite but all the females were very aggressive, loud, and rude. Flight number  AF1497  Thursday December 26th 2019 at 8:10 a.m. Never ever fly Air France from Casablanca, Morocco. Those female ground crew had an attitude of being miss high and mighty and wanted you to bow down to them. I will never ever forget the horrible experience we had at the hand of ground crew. Thank God we are back in our country.","2020-01-03"
"5","Great flight as always ","This flight was great! The business class of air France is always good, the service is perfect, the staff is really professional, and the food and wine are the best.
The long flights from air France are good. ","2020-01-03"
"1","Woeful customer experience with Air France","I booked a flight with Trip.com flying Air France, a return flight from Hong Kong to Birmingham. I was unable to fly on the outbound flight as I had flown to Europe a few days earlier on a Business Trip. I informed the airline of this (Air France), stating that I still intended to take the inbound (return) flight from Birmingham to Hong Kong. 

I arrived at the airport for the inbound (return) flight as per my itinerary, only to be told by the Air France staff that my flights had been cancelled and I would be unable to fly unless I paid a 500 Euros administration charge to get my flights reinstated. Air France had not informed me that my flights had been cancelled at any point, despite numerous correspondences during the prior month (including when I tried to check-in online - their only response was to tell me the staff at the departure airport would handle it... which they didn't!). 

I then had to pay a significant amount of money to fly on a flight that I had already paid to fly on. It caused me an incredible amount of distress and embarrassment as well as the obvious personal financial cost. To make matters worse, I was treated exceptionally badly by the Air France staff at Birmingham airport and during phone calls I had with them. 

Why was I not notified that my full journey had been cancelled because of not taking the outbound flight? 

The flight itself was really poor - leg room is terrible, it was too hot, the food is awful.","2020-01-02"
"2","Not so friendly airline","The staff were unfriendly and provided a bad service, worst airline service I’ve been on.  Our trip was in July and staff were not on helpful or friendly.  It has put me off using Air France","2020-01-02"
"5","My New Favorite Airline","We were flying back to the US from Paris after an 8 day stay when our original return flight was delayed, thus not giving us time to make our connection. Air France was able to accommodate us on a non-stop flight and even went so far as to upgrade us from economy to business class. Where many airlines do the bare minimum to accommodate passengers during flight interruptions, Air France went above and beyond to make our travel as seamless as possible. The onboard crew was just as amazing as the staff at the gate. We’ll be booking our next European adventures on AF!","2020-01-02"
"1","Air France","Not very friendly staff . The don’t give you anything considering the long flight . One food and one snack like apple sauce! Not flying with them again.","2020-01-02"
"2","Good hard product, terrible soft product","We were rebooked due to a misconnection onto Air France to Buenos Aires. The plane and the seats were good, the rest was a bad experience. The seats were filthy - we wiped them down with a wet wipe and they were black afterwards. The stewardess in my row only spoke Spanish neither English nor French with ended in me getting food etc I did not order just because she did not understand me. The flight attendants were pretty arrogant on top. 
Sorry this was a terrible experience!","2020-01-02"
"1","Dissapointing","I know Air France Economy have rather spacious seats compared to other economy flights. But of the three flights I took (there were two stops on the way) NONE OF THEM WAS AIR FRANCE! It was stated on the site that the two shorter flights were with KLM … but the longest flight was instead Ettihad - where the economy seats were VERY cramped. (To be fair, the staff on these cramped flights were excellent, But it was NOT what I paid for! Etihad was NOT on the ticket, it was Air France!) ---- I have yet to experience the return flight ... but it better be damn good! And it better BE Air France seats!","2020-01-01"
"5","Great service and flight.","Me and my gf flew to Caracas from Paris. It was the longest flight that I’ve ever been on just over 10 hours. The service was great the seats comfortable and the entertainment system good. All the staff on board was very professional and courteous. I would definitely recommend flying Air France. ","2020-01-01"
"5","Excellent Service and Great Cabin configuration - gives somewhat a ""first class"" feel","The business class experience was definitely among the best we have had with European airlines. We flew an Airbus A330-200. It had 36 flatbed business class seats and a 2-2-2 configuration. The seats are spread in two cabins which gives it an exclusive feel. 18.5 inch HD touch screen, 78-inch pitch, attentive and friendly flight crew, and french gourmet meals. As close to a first-class feel you can get for a business class flight. Also, they were on time.","2020-01-01"
"2","Don't use when traveling with small children","I strongly advise anyone travelling with small children within the age of 1-3 to use business class when using this airline. On our way back from Japan my family and I sat behind a Japanese man and two French women. After takeoff, it took my son a few minutes to settle down. The Japnese man being annoyed decided that he should take matters into his own hands and try to touch my son in an attempt to quiet him down. An altercation almost accorded, when we called the Airfrance attendant instead of coming to the persons that called her she dismissed us and went to the Japanse man and french women. Needless to say that we are a black family. What is funny about the situation is that they couldn't understand English, or pretended to, but gave a full account in French. The attendant only came to us after the family behind us explained to her what happened. This is terrible service and I warn anyone travelling on this Airline with small children to be wary of these terrible practices.","2019-12-13"
"3","Lagguge was delayed dued to a very short connection at Charls due Goul airprot!","The flight left on time and was overall OK. on the next flight from Paris to Luxembourg we had about 50 minutes layover. Our suitcases were left at Paris due to the short layover. when we arrived to Luxembourg we were told it always happens because the airport in Paris is packed. Airfrance/ Luxair knowingly sales those tickets without informing passengers.","2019-12-12"
"5","Trip to Paris","It was great and on time. The food was good and the service was excellent. We will be flying Air France again.","2019-12-12"
"2","Air France's failure to issue boarding passes for connecting flights in Cassablanca.","We landed late at CDG airport in Paris.  When we deplaned our connecting flight was boarding. 
There were 43 passengers in our group on the Air France flight connecting on a Delta Atlanta flight. Air France counter agents in Casablanca refused to provide boarding passes for at least half of the passengers for their connecting Delta flight.  AF counter agents also demanded that all luggage including carry on's be checked.  As a result 13 passengers were unable to board their connecting flight and they were stranded in Paris, some for at least two days, without any luggage,  jackets,  medication,  etc.
Word to the wise,  NEVER relinquish your carry on and ALWAYS demand your boarding pass for connecting flights on first leg of flight,  especially if other passengers are getting theirs for the same flight group.","2019-12-12"
"5","Food was a very poor choice for business class","Usual good service and comfortable seating. Food was a very poor choice for business class with 2 out of the 4 choices having shellfish, and the other a highly spiced sauce. Ineditable and potentially hazardous. Breakfast was no better with 2 over exotic non choices.
Disappointing, given how good the cabin crew were. .","2019-12-12"
"3","Last minute round trip to France","Due to an emergency and last minute booking, we had to book on economy class, all other seats on Premium economy were sold out.  The food from Atlanta was horrible compared to the food on our way back.  The service from Atlanta was not great too.  Boarding in Paris was chaotic.  Delta did a better job when we flew back from Paris in May.","2019-12-12"
"2","Worst Seat and Food","Times of departure were fine, personnel as well.
But the variety of food was awful also the quality of my seat for a 13 hour flight my ... was in so much pain that iit was the first time life i couldn't sleep","2019-12-12"
"2","Air France Ration Water Why","Flew economy from Paris CDG to Havanna Boarding was okay and seats had resonable pitch entertainment system had good selection. The cabin crew came round with drinks after first hour followed quickly by a meal, which was just palatable. Another drinks trolly run in the next hour. So we were 3hrs on a 10 hr flight at which point the crew disappeared. Passengers were wandering off in search of drinks. A steward came round with water after two hours. We were eventally given another drink with Breakfast during the last hour.","2019-12-12"
"1","Air France lost property, don't bother reporting when its gone, its gone.","Items lost inadvertently not collected from flight. 
One month on from detailing my  loss & location of the items on the flight theses have still not been located.
Air France why am I not surprised.
 The loss was noted immediately on departure at the arrival gate, security staff would not permit a return to the aircraft.
 The Air France desk requested that I submitted the respective loss report on line which was completed while the passengers were disembarking for the aircraft.
 As I was again not permitted to return & the Air France desk were being traditionally unhelpful I went to the AF lounge & requested further assistance was requested to recover the items.
 I even detailed where these items were located in the storage panel below the TV screen.
 A few phone calls latter I was again requested to submit a loss claims form!!!!!

 To date no update on the online claim, bye, bye Bose wireless headphones & I Apple AirPods.
 Being a frequent flyer for the past forty years I have always carried my own head phones mainly due for hygiene reasons.

 Traveling again to Caracas Venezuela in the new year I certainly will not be carrying anything of valve.","2019-12-11"

"1","CDG airport brand ambassador of racism","Well my mistake of ignoring google reviews of this particular combo. Racism is something which i read only in papers but now this fantastic combo has ensured that i have first hand experience of it. Since this portal is for tourism, i strongly recommend tourists to boycott and condemn France","2019-12-11"
"5","Helpful air crew","Just returned via Charles de Gaulle and totally different experience from flying with KLM. Flight crew pleasant and very helpful, particularly Security manager who confirmed our baggage was on the plane(we were concerned after problems we had with KLM) and she told us how to check with staff at Charles de Gaulle which we did. Flight left late but made up most of the time, only 10 minutes late.","2019-12-11"
"4","Better than average","I sat in seat 39A, so I cannot comment on legroom as this seat is near the galley/one of the restrooms and has that extended legroom by the emergency exit door. The restroom and galley were not a bother (flight was all day time). The plane was in good shape (777-300ER) and kept clean. I felt that the entertainment was bad to average..not many choices and those that were loaded were out of date. The meal service was disappointing: I was served last so my first choice was gone, second choice (chicken with honey sauce) was truly terrible...tasted like chicken with water poured over it as a sauce. The ""snack"" was a mushroom pizza bite, which had no pizza sauce so it turned out to be a cheese pocket and you were out of luck if you don't like mushrooms. The cabin crew responsible for my section of the cabin were great and very engaging and welcoming!","2019-12-11"
"5","Air borne","The Flight Attendants were very attentive, always smiling and helpful.  Head rests are adjustable.  The meals were delicious.","2019-12-11"
"5","Good leg space and courteous staff","I traveled in economy and the leg space was too good. The food was delicious and staff are courteous. They give printed food menu to all which I felt was not needed as most of them will throw away that. Post serving food, snacks like protein bar, juice, sandwich was there to help ourself.","2019-12-11"
"1","Worst flight ever","Let me begin by advising all readers that I’m not fond of flying. I do it because I want to enjoy my destinations and it is a means to an end. 
This was a long flight so It was never going to be easy for me. Saying that, Air France added to my anxieties rather than helping. From the off at Dublin, the check in staff were brash, rude and lacked any communication skills necessary for customer service. Staff on the flight were the same. There was a lot of turbulence. No communication to us as to why. They didn’t reassure me when I asked and advised them of my nervousness just awful. They allowed people to simply go to the “ bar” and drink it dry thus not allowing others to have a second drink. People just standing around drinking where the kitchen was. We didn’t find out about ice creams available as no one told us. Again by chance we saw others with them. Staff surly and unpleasant. 
I will try to avoid flying with them again
Compared to their sister company KLM, with whom we returned, chalk and cheese. They were amazing. 
Never again

"4","All three flights were on time.","Everything went smoothly on all three flights both outbound and inbound. That has to be a record. The flight attendants were friendly and the flights were smooth. No hassles with carry-ons having to be checked. All in all, uneventful - which is great.","2019-12-11"
"5","Excellent flight","Perfect flight, nice crew on board !
The food was good as well, even though you cannot order on a menu (just a choice between two sandwiches).","2019-12-10"
"5","Satisfaction","Always interesting to flight across France avoiding Paris. Despite some bad experiences with them, I have to recognize that flight was excellent once boarded .(waiting boarding room in Nice airport is a shame) 
Effective space for legs, cleaniless of the place obvious and staff really client oriented. 
Good flight .","2019-12-10"
"4","It was standard good","It was convenient the airline recomended the schedule when to come to the airport, how to check in the luggage. The flight was ok and service fine. It would be better to take on mind to let the snack warm a littlebit after taking out from fridge, It is not too nice to serve hot coffee and almost frozen donuts.","2019-12-10"
"5","An airline to trust","The boarding process was swift. They really started early, and saved a lot of time. The flight was still delayed but it was because of the traffic on the tarmac. The 777 airplane was clean and comfy. I flew 777 many times before. It is a good aircraft. It depends on which company runs it. The cabin service was excellent. I will fly Air Fracne again, and I highly recomment it if you are reading this review.","2019-12-09"
"4","Flights were good and on time. Legroom was rather limited in coach class.","Flight was good but long (nothing to do with airline). Food was OK for what is expected in economy. Service was friendly and good. Entertainment was varied with lots of good choices. Seats were reasonably comfortable, but there was less legroom than would be expected for an International flight, economy class not withstanding.","2019-12-09"
"3","PARIS WEEKEND","Poor food and beverage, uncomfortable seat,boarding mess and airline allowing people to carry on excess baggage.","2019-12-09"
"3","The flight was great, the ground employees at Orly not so much.","The flight crew was fantastic.  We had a problem with my fiancee's seat while still on the ground and they had a mechanic come and fix it immediately.  Even in economy the flight attendants were attentive and proactive.  (5 stars to the fight team).  However, the Air France ground staff at Orly made us questions if we would ever fl them again.  The ground staff was extremely rude (even by French standards) and abrupt.  Also I was flagged for extra security (which was not too bad and I get taking extra precautions), they separated us for that and put me on the plane directly from the additional screening.  They told me that they would tell my fiance where I was (ie on the plane), they did not and the lead to a lot of unneeded stress,  (1 star for the airport staff)","2019-12-09"
"3","Horrible food. Flight Attends huh!","I would NOT recommend Air France to anyone. Food was HORRIBLE for such a long flight, snacks was limited.","2019-12-09"
"2","Train your staff","It feels that Air France ave been cutting corners to save their profit, i flew with AF for over a decade, this is my last time flying with them, the reason is the flight attendant DAVID asked me how was my food and i replied garbage, because it was, i felt like a dog handing me my breakfast in a doggy bag, that's not SERVICE, the second part is i couldn't eat what was in the bag and was not offered anything else for me and my family. Mr David took it personal and started to say some words in Frensh and calling me names, he didn't know i speak frensh fluently. The service is not the same, the comfort is not there, the value we got doesn't match the price we paid.","2019-12-09"

"1","Air France terrible service","Our honeymoon couldn´t have ended worst than it did. We spent 15 day cruising and having the best time ever. Our last day in Rome was perfect. We took a plane from Rome to Paris. It was an early flight cause our connection flight was taking off around 11 in the morning. We arrived to Charles de Gaulle on time and everything seemed all right but then we saw that it was an hour delayed. It was ok, not too much time, an hour later the flight attendant spoke on the mic saying that there was going to be a 6 hour delay. We couldn't believe it. Thirty minutes later Our flight was completely cancelled. No explanation. llJust the flight attendant said that it was cancelled. Imagine a very large group of people. Many Mexicans in there, the ""service provided by Air France staff"", if we can call it like this,  was T E R R I B L E since the cancellation of the flight. It took more than 8 hours to solve the way we were going to go back to Mexico City. Nobody knew anything. All the passengers were left by themselves. no guidance, Nothing! 
We were lucky to get a flight to Houston the next day and then a flight to Mexico City. 
I can understand that cancelations may occur but it is the way the AIR FRANCE staff handled the situation. They didn´t follow a protocole, Passengers get worried, angry and the only thing we want to hear as passengers is that you are in the best hands of professional people. We didn`t get any of these.","2019-12-09"
"1","It was the last  flight with Air France company","It was the last time when I choose Air France for travel. 25 minutes delay in Paris, after they live Vancouver with 15 minutes delay, the passengers waiting in the bus on the runaway more than 15 minutes for cleaning the airplane, arriving in Paris with 25 minutes delay, almost to miss the connecting flight to Bucharest, with very rude officers at the control point, with no transfer for our luggage to Bucharest flight, thing that I could understand for the delay BUT with a lot of stuff missing from our luggage when they finally arrive home (after 1 day and half). The final balance for our  damage: a new bought suitcase damaged and missing stuff about 2000 euros including clothing,  footwear, sunglasses, wine, sweets and many other things. You have to be attentive at the food in the aurplabe because one of us (we were 4 in that flight) had serious injuries for the stomach and gall. It was awfull. We had a former flights with Air France a couple of year ago but in this moment the company is on the free fall. Awful! Not recomended! Not at all...","2019-12-09"
"5","Excellent service on board and online checkin easily done, I recommend this airline","My experience with Air France was excellent. Boarding such a huge airplane was very well organized just in both, going and arrival. The service on board is also excellent
I recommend it","2019-12-09"
"4","Vancouver to Paris and return on direct flight","It is the 3rd time we use AF to Paris. Very convenient direct flights,most days. The food leaving YVR was not impressive, old bread bun, fairly tasteless prepared in Vancouver I guess. It was much better coming back from Paris. The personnel does not spend much time in the Premium cabin, so stock up on your wine or liqueur when you see them, you won't have another chance. Premium cabin is pleasant, intimate, I wish the seats reclined more, but good legroom. Good entertaining system.","2019-12-09"
"1","Disaster","My mother was due to fly from Dubai to Bordeaux at 1:30 am on 10 December 2019. We were informed at 7:00 pm on 9 December 2019 by text message that the flight had been cancelled due to the strikes; and then informed at 9:30 pm by text message that my mother was scheduled on a flight from Dubai to Beirut departing at 10:25 pm that night (less than an hour notice). The flight would then take her from Beirut to Paris CDG and then Paris Orly to Bordeaux.  Resulting in over 23 hours of travelling time. 

We tried calling all 24 hour numbers in the UAE and France; and could not get through to anyone. We had several phones calling all the various telephone numbers; and after 30 minutes of waiting, the lines would cut. 

We therefore had to go to the Dubai International Airport to find out what was going on. We arrived at 9:40 pm; and were informed to go to the check-in counter to speak to a representative of Air France. There were no Air France representatives; and were informed that they were coming but to just sit and wait.

The Air France representatives finally arrived at 10:00 pm. This in itself was appalling. All news outlets have been annoucing the strikes all across France, which will impact all modes of transportation. I am at a complete loss as to how Air France did not foressee the problems that this would cause passengers, and therefore planned to have their representatives available at the airport to help them rebook flights.

The Air France representative proceeded to inform us that the strike was only today, and the flights would be back to normal tomorrow. Once again, I had to inform him that I had read on the news that the strikes will be tomorrow as well. 

We therefore finally managed to get my mother's flight re-booked to Thursday, 12 December 2019. 

Overally, the service received by Air France was appaling until the representative finally arrived to assist us. However, this only happened after getting annoyed with another member of staff from the ground operators.","2019-12-09"
"2","At least we got home","We were left for 3 days with no luggage and with no assistance from Air France staff.
When we complained we were again ignored by Air France because any complaints had to be made online.

Eventually they made an offer but we have to fly via Paris which is not really convenient when going anywhere in Europe.

It seems we are not the first to suffer in this way with this airline.","2019-12-09"
"1","Flight to Rome to pick up cruise","My wife and I flew to Rome from Manchester to pick up a cruise,ten days in the med

Worst though it was not there problem refused any form of compensation.

Will not fly with again","2019-12-09"

"5","Service Like in Days of Old!","The food, beverage, and service are wonderful!  Like most airplanes today, economy is crowded but the courtesy and service and food served while on board make up for the other.  I will fly Air France whenever possible.","2019-12-09"
"4","Bettre than most","Good flight and service,  If you are over 5' 9"" you will have issues with the legroom.  Left and arrived on time","2019-12-09"
"3","Average","Very small and not easy to get to your seat especially if you’re at the back. Aircraft looked old and outdated. Only one aisle. I suppose it’s a quick flight from Geneva to Paris, still expected a bit more.","2019-12-09"
"3","Premium economy experience","This was my first experience of flying with Air France and I found it a bit hit and miss.
On the plus side CDG airport was clean and easy to get around, the flights were on time and the premium economy cabin on the Dreamliner was bright and spacious with big comfortable seats.
The service on board was efficient and friendly. The entertainment system was reasonably good but the WIfi did not work.
On the minus side the food was average at best and it did not seem to be a great deal different to the economy class meals.
The drinks service was almost non existent and on the return flight from Nairobi to CDG I had to visit the galley a few times due to thirst.
Another bad point was that even though this was a daytime flight the cabin was darkened, an age old method used to keep the passengers quiet!
Overall, I don't think that premium economy was great value for money.","2019-12-04"
"3","Returning back to bko","I was already exhausted from other long flight when i boarded the plane. There was too many checks on my boarding pass as if i couldn afford prenium?.. on the other hand the plane was brand new and the flight was very confortable despite the fact that we took off like really late","2019-12-04"
"4","Flying Air France Experience","It was my second time flying Air France. I never had any bad experience on bith times, aside from the 4 hours delay from CDG to JFK due to the snow. They wash out the airplane.

Seats are very spacious considering for me.

I also noticed that food quality is getting bad.I think all airlines are doing that just to reduce the flight fare.

In general my experience is very good. No complaints from my side. The fact that I got the flight at a very cheap price.

I will fly air france again.","2019-12-04"
"1","Flight was cancelled and I miss all following connection flights","Flight was cancelled at the last minute and they changed us to Emirates air which is one hour later and the problem was that you have to go to another terminal and you have to get into a bus and carry all your bags etc while my booking was business so the least expected that they provide a car to transfer us to the other terminal. 

When I arrived CDG I realized I am in the wrong terminal for my connection flight On Air France Because my flights was on emirates not air france  as it was supposed to be. it takes about 30 mins to change the terminal By bus including waiting time for the bus. 

As soon as I arrived at my gate the lady rejected to let me in even though I arrived 20mins before departure And she was very rude. Her action caused me that I lost all my later connection flights and hotel booking as the next flight is 24 hours later.","2019-12-03"
"1","rediclous cancleation policy","I missed the 24 hour cancellation policy by 1 hour and they want $1,500.00 to reschedule my flight,  the travel agent says that i cant have a refund because Air France would have to authorize it,  when I call Air France they say they would refund it but the travel agency has to call.  

When the travel agent calls Air France, Air France says that they cannot do it. 

Super Frustrating.

Book with a better airline like Delta","2019-12-03"
"5","Great experience ","After our previous experiences with BA we figured we had little to lose by trying Air France. In fact they put BA to shame in every way.

Both our flights were on time (something BA has never yet managed). The plane was spotlessly clean and modern inside. All the crew were very professional and friendly. Best of all you get a complimentary snack and drink which actually makes you feel appreciated as a customer - other airlines take note! Finally CDG terminal 2E was a wonderful experience too both arriving and departing. ","2019-12-03"
"5","Comfortable,even in economy class. Attentive and friendly crew.","The only negative was charles de Gaulle airport, which has nothing to do with the airline. Chaotic,disorganised!","2019-12-03"
"5","Best Experience Ever","I have flown many “red eyes” cross country or across country. This was my first experience flying Air France. It was a superb experience. I was honestly shocked with the excellent service and food I ever received. Food was great, seats in economy were roomy and everything was prompt from boarding to disembarking. I have flown for 40 years now and was at the point I dreaded flying. Baggage claim can be nightmarish grim in Boston. The ground crew had it out and I picked up luggage 15 minutes of arrival. I will Pick this airline above all others in future.","2019-12-03"
"5","Upgrades are really nice!","Okay, I paid to upgrade to Premium economy after having lately traveled on budget airlines. I am very happy that I did and I think it was worth it. Of course flying on a foreign airline is different than flying on an airline that gives you a lower price and a lower degree of comfort. I won't name names. It was nonstop which is always nice, I had enough room to be comfortable, I had a real meal and plenty of wine if I wished more. I even had a blanket and a pillow! When was the last time you got them?? So, I had the opportunity and the funds to get the upgrade-next time I might not be so lucky but I can remember how nice that Air France flight was!!","2019-12-02"
"3","LAX to Basel via Paris connection","Disappointment, not as advertised on AIR France website: Seats are smaller than SWA!? Buffet is only available for business and 1st class. Meal was minimal by any standard.

"3","AIrbus.....Yes its Big but that's were it ENDS!!!!","My Trip to Berlin was the 2nd one in four years, needless to say, our check from O.R. tambo was fine, untill we landed in Paris which was our connecting stop to Berlin. The Airbus infotaiment screen are not good quality and the movies selection is not great if you are a movie fanatic like me, also just be prepared to run the Paris airport because the connection time is short, you might have time for coffee to refresh but not to relax, because the distance to the connection terminal is far. The connecting flight was just a standard Air France, plane nothing to write about, arriving in Berlin ""Tegel Airport"" we did not find our luggae, filled in some ppaer work to register for our luggae, hours later bags arrived at the hotel with mine being broken. So not a good experience with Air France and I doubt that I willl use it again in the future even though my bag was replaced after registering the claim back at O.R. Tambo.","2019-12-01"
"1","I’ll never fly with Air France again","My wife and I had a bad experience with Air France. We flew from Beirut Lebanon to Washington USA on October 23. All of our four luggages were delayed, we received the last one four days after we landed.
The bag have traveled half of the planet (Africa then Europe then USA) with very bad treatment. Most of its contents are broken and in very bad condition.
We did a claim to Air France, their partner Delta airlines have handled the claim. They are unprofessional, they don’t read, don’t listen and don’t respect the customer. Finally the claim was closed without any compensation after all the inconvenience that we afford.
Most of  Air France travelers complain of delayed luggage.
Thank you Air France!!!!","2019-12-01"
"5","Comfortable and Accomodating","Boarding was efficient, seating seemed to be a little more legroom, food was good and the wine flowed. There were sufficient movies and programs to entertain you for the entire flight if you don't sleep. I have traveled on Air France previously and have had no problem with them at all.","2019-12-01"
"4","Good long haul","Good flight, great crew, the only downside was the return flight was with a partner organization and Air France passed no information about disability or dietary requirements on","2019-12-01"
"5","Air France — Superior to Alitalia","On the day we were traveling in late November from Rome to Boston, Alitalia was not flying non-stop from Rom etc Boston. So we flew from Rome to Paris on Alitalia, which was adequate, thanks to the fact that the flight was not full and I was asked to fly in an exit row seat which had plenty of leg room. Had I flown for two hours in my assigned seat just behind the exit row, I might have needed orthopedic surgery to move from my seat upon arrival at Paris, as the leg room was meant for persons under 5’6” at best. In any event, having now arrived at DeGaulle, I had the pleasure of flying Air France, notwithstanding that I was booked on economy. The flight was undersubscribed; I had an empty seat next to my window seat with adequate legroom and better yet  the person in front of me did not recline his seat much, if any at all. Contrary to Alitalia steward practices, none of the staff went to sleep during the flight. Moreover, the dinner was served reasonably promptly and it was much superior (including the wine) to what Alitalia now serves in economy. Kudos to Air France. But for the fact it has no nonstop flights from Rome to Boston, I would never sign up for Alitalia again.","2019-12-01"
"1","Crammed In Like A Cattle Car","I am a small person, and I was so tight in my seat I could barely move. I cannot imagine what anyone taller or heavier felt like. It is absolutely cruel. 

Finally, several into the flight, I needed to get up to use the bathroom. After apologising to my neighbour for having to climb over him, I went to the nearest rest room. I was told I could not use that one - premium class only! I marched back to the aft of the plane to find a line for the only 2 units for all of us plebes. (It wouldn't surprise me if that sort of thing constitutes a health hazzard.) After that, the stewardess kept coming to ""check on me"" to make sure I had my seatbelt fastened. She kept making me show her! I couldn't wait to get off that flying kennel.","2019-12-01"
"4","Good-priced Tickets for Low Peak Travel","Managed to get good priced economy tickets for 2 to transiting flights from Singapore to Paris then to Italy. Ample transit time when we flew to Italy but on the return trip it was cutting close as we still had to clear departure customs. Food-wise desserts were better than the main meal. When my wife and I arrived at Singapore, one check-in luggage was still in France even though it was checked in together. Fortunately, the airports managed to find and send it back to me.","2019-12-01"
"1","NO ONE HELPS, ITS NOT THEIR JOB","Air France is dead to me. Get to the agent to pay for an extra bag, she goes on break. Then we wait, wait, wait, wait ......wait, wait... for someone to come, then their credit card maxhine is broke. Then I am sent to another then another. We arrive at CDG at 7:10am..... we got to our gate at 10:10 am right before they close the doors. The most consistant answer I got was, “Sorry Messieur its not my job and I am going on break, but you can loadge a complaint on the web site” . Security was bad, but even that only took 20 minutes. 

If I could have scored a -15 I would have.","2019-11-30"
"1","Worst custumer service ever!","The staff is sooooo rude. They don't have communication between them. The lady of security started screaming at me because she told me to remove my shoes and put in the tray, the other guy told me that i don't have to remove my shoes. When i passed security the lights turned red and the lady with bad temper started saying shoes, shoes, shoes...I apologizes but she continues screaming at me. As costumer service they should be polite! Same happen at the counter! I haven't slept, I almost loose the flight because of them,..  in conclusion The worst experience ever!","2019-11-30"
"3","Unsure of this review","Ok, let me clearify why I am unsure of this review. I`m unsure how to go about it, really. Let`s begin with the Osl-Cdg flight. first leg. No troubles checking in, boarding etc (I`ve been working at Osl airport for 13 years, so can`t really throw me any curveballs there). I am 185 cm, and i must say, air france is by far the worst airline i`ve ever flown on from a legroom point of view. I was hugely dissapointed by that. Service and crew was nice and all, no problem there, but comfort was horrible. Out of paris i`ve got an upgrade to business-class, route flown with an A380. Now, i just love the A380, it`s my favourite aircraft. And also, an upgrade from economy to business, i din`t feel it`s fair to complain, wich i dont. I had a very pleasant flight to Johannesburg indeed. But- here`s the thing. If I had payed full price business(as i do from time to time), and the A380 had been operating the route, i would`ve feel cheated out of my money. The business-seats on their A380 is really really dated, and they should not charge full price for these seats as with their new product, regardless of service on the ground. But again, i was upgraded, so it was a win for me regardless. But check what aircraft is operating your route before shelling out your hard earned money, i know i wil. So, for giving me good service, upgrade and all, i should be giving them 5/5, but looking at the bigger picture, i just can`t.","2019-11-30"
"5","Fantastic Flight","What a great flight.  The attendants were super and the food was outstanding. This was my very first time to fly out of the US, and I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of this overnight flight.","2019-11-09"
"5","Best Service in the Market","Air France is a great airline.  Service is always excellent and they seem to have all the logistics associated with boarding and baggage loading/unloading down to a science, assuring on-time departures.","2019-11-09"
"3","It's okay to travel","The seats were okay, the food was okay with the exception of what i think was scrambled eggs? The movie selection is good, but my Aux output from my monitor was terrible! I couldn't move to much or touch the cable or else it would pop out, all the movies i had to hear it with the background noise louder than the voices of people speaking... I even tried my own headsets and same thing; terrible way to watch a movie. And I had to sit next a guy that was partially on my seat, so the whole 10 hours I had to sit a bit sideways to not bump shoulders or fight for the arm rest! What a horrible way to sit and travel... and I paid for a whole seat? And this guy paid as much as i did to have a seat and 1/4 of another seat? Fat people need to lose weight or sit in first class! Im upset that i have to pay the consequences of being uncomfortable because someone else can't control how much they eat!","2019-11-09"
"4","Very Nice Airline","I had never flown Air France before.  I flew on 11/5 from Budapest to Paris and then had a connection from Paris to Houston.  The larger plane flown from Paris to Houston was very nice and well maintained.  Th seats were comfortable even in Economy.  The food service was quite nice.  I wish I had been offered beverages more often.  The restrooms became very dirty (all surfaces were wet) and required cleaning.  The crew did not regularly check the restrooms.  The smell wafted into the cabin and was unpleasant. Aside from the restrooms not being cleaned often enough it was a nice more importantly uneventful safe flight.","2019-11-09"
"2","Flights are on-time, airplanes are old, and service is terrible","The flight itself was fine - the planes are old and dingy. But the service is left out of customer service. Despite the fact that I'm a Delta Platinum Medallion member, I can't get the correct miles because their Flying Blue employees are incompetent. I can only imagine how they treat their non-premium passengers.","2019-11-08"
"3","Air France could use some improvements","Atlanta to Paris to Dehli in Dec. 2018. Returned Singapore to Paris to Atlanta Feb 2019. Paul checked us in in Atlanta, and was a very odd/bizarre person letting us know how he felt about where we were going, which wasn't good. I would not want Paul to be the face of my business. Flight attendants were a littel rude. Nothing glaring, just an overall attitude of complacency and rudeness. Everything else was simply very average as compared to other airlines.","2019-11-08"
"4","A Very Comfortable 380 to Los Angeles","I wrote another review about Air France on their Seattle/Paris route. This trip was much more comfortable, with excellent service and staff and with comfortable seating. From the moment I boarded in Paris the crew was friendly and helpful. Boarding was super efficient and it was easy to get settled in. On the 380, the upper deck is almost all Business Class with a small Economy cabin in the back. While Air France is in the process of re-furbishing their fleet, the 380 is not currently scheduled for this. I was not sure of what to expect with the cabin. While the seating is a 2-2-2 configuration the seats themselves are quite comfortable and there is sufficient storage along with easily accessible outlets. The entertainment screen is large and is touch sensitive making it easy to use. The seat itself has several different settings making it very comfotable for this long, daytime flight. Unlike the new cabins, these seats do not have privacy from your neighbor, but that doesn't really bother as it does some. 

The crew were very helpful throughout the flight. The meal service was excellent and the food served was surprisingly good, especially when compared to my flight over. Throughout the flight, the FAs were available and there was an excellent snack and beverage bar set up in the galley. Overall, an excellent flight. I just wish the service on Air France was more consistent throughout it's routes, especially on long haul.","2019-11-08"
"2","Very Disappointed","I have flown AF in the past in business and have had a great experience. This flight is one of the worst flights I have been on in a very long time, certainly the worst I've had in international business. The day started with a notice that my afternoon flight to Paris had been cancelled. While frustrating, it has never happened to me so I didn't get worked up about it, I just started the process of re-routing. As I was on the phone with Delta, (the codeshare I booked with), I got a second email that the flight had been delayed by 4 hours. Needless to say I was relieved.

The plane was re-scheduled from an afternoon departure to around 6:00 PM. From the moment I was on board the crew seemed almost grumpy. Perhaps they were tired, perhaps they were frustrated by the delay but honestly, each one of the attendants I encountered seemed to be robotically going through the motions. In fact beyond the initial dinner service, The attendants remained in the galley until the meal before landing. 

The plane itself was an extrememly tired looking A-330. Air France is in the process of re-furbishing their planes and this one clearly hasn't had the upgrade. The seats were angled, not lie flat, the entertainment screen was easily 10 years old, small and difficult to work, and overall the the seating area seemed worn and tired. I was able to get some sleep, but not much. 

And the food was terrible for both meals, just really terrible. I don't expect much regarding airplane food, but this was an all time low. 

The bottom line is that the Seattle/Paris trip on Air France left a lot to be desired. I traveled back through LAX on Air France and had a completely different and positive experience, which I'll write about in another review.","2019-11-08"
"2","Not Kid friendly and relunctant to provide service","I had ordered special meal for my child a baby meal, some how it was not there on list flight attendants have, however they were not willing to serve normal food also to my daughter although they changed same amount of money for her. I had to fight to get meals from them.","2019-11-08"
"5","Excellent flight","The flight on time, staff very professional, the service is at the top. The service before and after the flight excellent, the booking and check in very easy. I highly recommand airfrance","2019-11-08"
"1","Rubbish ","After using numerous different airlines to numerous different places this is the first and last time we use Air France.
Travelled Paris-Orly to Fort de France Martinique 2/11/19 premium economy IFE SCREEN NOT WORKING. AFter complaining all we got was an email saying “sorry hope to see you again sometime “!
Travelled back from Guadeloupe to Paris-Orly 7/11/19 (different plane) screen worked fine HOWEVER neither of our screens had any sound nor did our controls work. Food inedible. All in all with the money paid to fly premium economy it was disgraceful. Never again","2019-11-08"
"4","Comfortable","This flight was quite long with a stop over in paris but it was comfortable. Flight to paris from Nairobi was quite comfortable with the seats having enough leg room. Food was okay as expected of airline food. 

They had a good selection of entertainment to keep you busy during the 8 hour flight. Everything went smooth.","2019-11-07"
"4","Good flight and good service fit an hour fight.","This flight was good and the flight attendants were very professional and friendly.  The seats are VERY close together and a bit stiff but I like the airline fit short and long distance travel (however long distance in business class with more leg room would be a priority.  Boarding and bag check in are very efficient.","2019-11-07"
"4","Keep it up","Airfrance flies to Abuja at least 3 time or so per week from Paris. Sometimes it combines their flights through chad to enable them make the trips especially when they do not have sufficient passengers on that route. To me it helps because they kept the rout alive and still make profit margin which helps us still fly the airline we love.","2019-11-07"
"4","Best way to fly economy","Good advice from the Air France supervisor helped us select best itinerary at best price. We were very satisfied. I was disappointed in the quality of the food this trip, AF seems to have had to cut corners but still better than some other airlines.","2019-11-07"
"5","Brilliant business product","This is how business travel should be. Great cabin, great seats and attentive, friendly crew. An overall top experience on this leg. 

Unfortunately, the connection for last sector from CDG to MAN was shocking as AF used a Flybe “service” instead. This was a cramped, single-classed economy flight. As I’d paid for a Business return, the least I should have got.","2019-11-07"
"1","Air France Business?? Only if it suits them!","I flew AF from Manchester to Bangkok on a return business class ticket. From day one, whilst I was able to arrange seats for 3 of the 4 legs, I was unable to do anything about pre-selection of my seat for the last leg (BKK-CDG). When on line check in was available for my return, it transpired I was to fly the last leg with AF’s “partner”, FLYBE. The plane was single class (economy), cramped, dirty and a shoddy experience. Thank goodness it was only an hour. That said, it was an hour after a long flight and including layover was around 16 hours. Come on AF. When I book business return, I expect to get what I paid. Thus really will deter me from using you again - pity because as a regular user of your services so far, this seems to have been easy for you to avoid!","2019-11-07"
"5","Excellent service!","Amazing flight and service. Didnt know what to expect as i had never flown with them before but loved every minute. Even in economy you are offered a snack and even an alcoholic beverage which is amazing.","2019-11-07"
"4","Air France vs EasyJet and ","Cabin luggage maximum weight allowance which makes it lower than easy jet. Short delays on both my flights but not as long as easy jet.
Seats are better quality, and there are snacks and drinks included for the flight unlike easy jet where you have to pay extra.","2019-11-07"
"3","Every flight we had was late","Every flight we had with air france was late / delayed (3 of them) which caused us to miss our connecting flights and impose extra costs to us  (hotels, transfers, etc). We  will get reimbursed from our travel insurance but we still lost a day of our holiday.","2019-11-06"
"4","No elbow room","Long flight that had a good dinner and plenty of movies and TV shows to choose from. Service was good. They gave you a pillow and blanket should you wish to sleep. The seats were crammed together so that when dinner was served you had difficulty using the utensils. Isle room was narrow and leg room was tight.","2019-10-23"
"2","Nope... just nope","I flew with Airfrance and my experience was terrible. I booked 2 seats as someone who was heavier set just in case since I didn’t know if they would kick me off and flight attendants kept trying to place people in my extra seat. When explaining that I actually purchased the seat, they weren’t very understanding and would be rude to me. I also understand that when going on a foreign airline you will come across a language barrier but on one of the many flights I was going on with them, they only spoke French and I couldn’t understand what the flight crew was talking about. Will be sticking with Delta when it comes to transcontinental flights in the future.","2019-10-23"
"1","Uncaring, unsympathetic, non-flexible","The unfortunate hospitalization of my daughter while in Europe required me to make an immediate flight reservation to fly from JFK to Munich. I also needed to upgrade her ticket by hospital order that she must lie down due to a significant concussion. The tickets were initially handled by Delta, but everything else was Air France. 
I was able to upgrade her after 2 hours on the phone, and had to take whatever ticket was available for me at short notice, that ended up being premium economy. We were told to speak with Air France in Munich upon our return to hopefully have me closer to her, as I need to check on her while flying. We are now sitting at Munich airport completely disgusted with their lack of caring or flexibility. At check in we asked to change my ticket and were told that we could not. The ticket they booked for me apparently could not be changed - a direct contradiction to what I was told in the phone. I was willing to pay for an upgrade, but was told that I could not, I would have to purchase a brand new ticket and lose all the money payed for the old one. Are you kidding me?!?! I am traveling because of a family medical injury/ hospitalization and the fact that Air France is so rigid and inflexible is unacceptable. Additionally, my daughters ticket allowed her to visit the lounge, and although I had premium and alerted the airline to our issue, they would not let me go in with her. We are now together (of course) at the gate, and my daughter is laying on the dirty floor with head and neck pain. We haven’t even gotten on the flight yet and the stress is sky high. It is UNBELIEVABLE that no one could make the changes necessary happen. 
On a side note, I suffer from celiac disease and no where on check in is there a computerized option to chose a safe meal. The number Delta provides rings endlessly, and I could not get through. My assumption is that even if I did get a person on the phone, they would have told me I needed to contact Air France (a useless option)
Air France shame on you!
You’re inflexible and uncaring. In the future we will make a point to avoid your airline and advise others to do the same
We are still at the airport and just were told that my daughters skis were in the wrong place even though we followed the exact directions of the check in woman.
The woman at the gate check in was extremely rude.
We travel often and have never had such a negative and unpleasant experience","2019-10-23"
"4","HK-PARIS-AMSTERDAM (Vegetarian Hindu Meal)","Flew with Air France from Hong Kong, being a vegetarian (no meat or seafood) i read a lot of forums before booking the right in-flight meal because often it is mistaken that vegetarians eat seafood. Therefore, I selected 'Vegetarian Hindu Meal' which included Black Lentil, Bell pepper with rice. Will not rate it tasty but it was just OK. For breakfast there was Corn with White Channa and beneath was a thin layer of 3-4 Bhatura's, the taste was definitely good but Bhatura's were soggy, wouldn't have been if they were served separately. But i guess booking the meal in advance saved me from being hungry as there are limited options left, if you are a vegetarian. 
I had a connecting flight from Hong Kong to Paris and Paris to Amsterdam. In flight from Paris everyone was served croissant with coffee. Croissant was very cold, felt it would have been nice they could have served it warm and yes, you just get one, there is no replenishment","2019-10-22"
"3","Not great flights","Late departure on both flights. Lucky we had no connections. Return flight was from Strasbourg and the service at the Strasbourg airport was poor. We had no meal on the way back as there was a strike of the service department, luggage personnel, catering, etc... we had to pay extra for our luggage, we had payed on our way their but thought it was in our booking for both flights. Upon checking in we did not notice that we had to pay extra for this suitcase. They charged us double the price we should of payed on line. We explained that there was no mention of extra payments, but they were not understanding. We thought that was pretty poor service....","2019-10-22"
"5","Best trans-Atlantic flight ever.","I have flown round-tripfrom the USA to various European destinations about 15 times, mostly in coach but about six times in business class, on American, Delta, Lufthansa, USAir, and Italia. This was my first experience with Air France. The accommodation was better than I’ve seen, in that the seat was truly lie-flat, with no awkwardly placed joints, and enough length for my 6’3” frame. 

However, the real treat was the meal. My wife and I ordered different dishes but we both agreed the meals were up to fine restaurant standards.  Kudos to the French.","2019-10-22"
"5","New Airfrance business is very nice","I flew a few times before on europe to asia flights with Airfrance in business class and the seat used to be really bad (large seat but not reclinable to flat bed) compared to other airlines. In the meantime Airfrance changed business class seats to upgrade to a flat bed seat like Cathay Pacific for example, so in my flight this month I experienced new seats: they are as good as other airline now and fully reclinable to flat bed so this is great! Regarding service, food and drinks, Airfrance used to be great but they also improved from my point of view. I can say the food and drinks are really amazing now and much better than any other airline! Cathay food in business is so so but with AirFrance, it is really great!!!! Fresh and delicious food, wine is really nice (white was sancerre and red was Saint Julien - Fiefs de Lagrange 2012). I really had the best inflight experience ever. Nothing negative to say, congratulations AirFrance, you really corrected all bad things! Cabin crew is attentive and remembers what you chose and is proposing extra things (like espresso).
Inflight video is great too, reactive, big HD screen, good selection and good noise cancellation headset!
I loved it (if I had to make a review a few years before, I would not be that positive!)","2019-10-22"
"4","Pleasant flight","The first leg of the trip (Abuja-Paris) was quite smooth. So was the second leg from Paris to New York. In both cases there were a few minor cases of turbulence but the pilots handled the situation competently. There's nothing as reassuring as when a pilot communicates well with passengers on how the trip is going. Air France pilots do that well. The only underside is that I wish their menu had more variety. Overall a pleasant experience.","2019-10-22"

For the rest departure and arrival on time - a plus, poor quality of dinner and horrible breakfast, poor, poor service in the cabin- lazy staff, trays sitting for more than an hour, dirty toilets. As a loyal AF customer I could just see a decline. Definitely needs work for much required improvement.","2019-10-21"

"3","PARIS to TAHITI & TAHITI to PARIS","I recently flew from Dublin to Tahiti via Paris & Los Angeles.  & Back again on same route. I really enjoy business class and was happy to utilize the lounges especially in Paris. The flight was good however the toilet in the front of business class was not working both going and coming, so not plan to fix the toilet anytime soon it would appear ( Yes it was the same plane ) Entertainment aboard is not as good as other airlines, for me not too many new releases worth watching and the general collection needs updating. Sorry to say but yet again I have been totally disappointed with the food, worst food ever. They try too hard to make Novelle Cuisine but its terrible. I just don't know who dreams up these menu's. Noty everybody eat natural yogurt it seemed to be on every meal tray. Really terrible food sorry, especially for business class.","2019-10-21"

"1","Do not fly with Air France!!!!!!!","Rude and insincere behaviour from staff! Checked in online the 18th of october and choose seats for both flights with Air France (Lima-Paris, Paris-Gothenburg). The flight to Paris the next day was delayed so we had to run to the transit gate and were at the gate during expected boarding. We were relieved to see that the plane to Gothenburg was delayed so we could relax. 40 minutes after the plane was supposed to leave (but boarding had not even started) we recieved a message that our tickets had been cancelled and were rebooked for a flight the next day (involving of course an inconvinient transit)! The staff told us they had made the decision to give up our seats for sale when they saw that the flight from Lima was delayed?? I highly suspect overbooking and them not being sincere about it (the same staff knew the flight to Gothenburg was severly delayed and the message of our cancellation and rebooking occured 50 minutes after we arrived at the gate). Turns out the was seats available to the same destination a few hours later and the inconvinient flight the next day was absolutely not the only option, apperently if you stand your ground and are a bit of a pain in the ass, you will get better treatment! I would not recommend Air France, previous flight history includes lost  and ruined baggage! Would suggest Turkish airlines or KLM when possible!","2019-10-20"
"5","Superb Experience in Business Class","Fantastic experience: staff very considerate and attentive. After a glass of champagne or juice (not great), asked immediately if I wanted to have a full dinner, or à la carte, if I wanted be awakened for the full breakfast or wait until close to landing for just coffee and pastries... Handed me a full menu and the choices were the classics: between Western and Oriental.
The food was excellent with a choice of 3 delightful different cakes at the end. Wine, a Châteauneuf du Pape was first rate. Full flat bed with a duvet quilt. Slept like a log, quietly. Good breakfast and lots of personal attention with a delicacy rarely experienced.
On the whole, I strongly recommend the airline and this class of service. It is really service but with a delicate and considerate touch well worthwhile.","2019-10-20"
"5","Great Service Huge A380","We took Air France round trip on an A380 which is huge and the only plane you can stand without crouching.  Two meals served and drinks any time. Flight attendants were courteous and helpful.   Clean plane.  We booked seats that were only two next to the exit door.   Good news you can stretch your legs, bad news is you don’t have under seat storage.  But I’d book those seats again for the leg room.","2019-10-20"
"1","never using air france again","I would not recommend AirFrance ever again! Worst flight ever. Tightest seats ever, no room for anything. Bumped us off of our second flight from Paris to Nice super last minute. If I could rate zero stars I would !","2019-10-20"
"3","Air France: Safe but Bland","Founded in 1933, Air France is the flag carrier of, well, France. With a fleet size of 224 aircraft, the airline services approximately 200 destinations in 78 countries. Over the years, Air France has developed something of a reputation for being stylish and refined just like its home country.

While I’m sure the “stylish” reputation is merited for premium and business classes, my experience in lowly economy was fairly standard; that is to say, the seats were narrow and cramped aboard our A320-200. There’s a reason why “economy” in the modern day has colloquially been referred to as cattle-class. It’s just not that comfortable. Additionally, the cabin crew were cordial, but hardly what I’d call friendly. In many ways, they reminded me of Air Canada’s flight crews: Cold, almost robotic. There was one bright spot in our flight from AMS to CDG, though. Even though the total flight time was barely over an hour and fifteen minutes, we were served a decent snack – a pesto sandwich with beverage. It might not be much, but it’s still lightyears better than what you get on Canadian carriers during “short” flights (i.e.: less than 2 hours), which is a whole lot of nothing . . . unless you pay.

All in all, as a seasoned traveler, I’d rate Air France a solid 3-stars for my experience in economy class. The airline has a decent safety record; the aircraft are well maintained and clean; and the staff are cordial, though maybe a little too much like automatons. While I was disappointed that the originally scheduled A318 was replaced by the A320, it was still nice to fly on this national carrier for the first time and, once at CDG, to see one of their (retired) Concorde (F-BVFF) on display.","2019-10-20"
"4","Air France/KLM (Internal) - Short Review","To be honest, I don't have any complaints about the airline in spite of the short delay we had (weather conditions, you can't really blame them for the weather). The staff was really friendly and polite, and the comfort of the seats was what one expects for an economy flight","2019-10-10"
"5","Flight to Yerevan","Currently there are no direct flights from the UK to Armenia but Air France via Paris works very well. The stopover in Paris was not rushed and the food on board was nicer than BA. Sitting in an aisle seat I had enough space but bigger people were quite squashed and the flight was full.
The stopover does help to break up an otherwise fairly long flight.","2019-10-10"
"5","NYC to Italy","Air France knows how to take care of it's passengers.  The food is top quality, compared to most airlines and their Flight Attendants are helpful without being in your face for 8hrs straight.  We had a connecting flight in CDG airport and our flight was delayed a few minutes at the start.  The Air France staff took the time to make sure we knew exactly how to navigate to our next flight and moved us to Business Class towards the end of the flight so that we could exit the plane first.  When we arrived at our connecting flight gate, the staff was informed that we were running late and we were given a fast pass through TSA.  Amazing service, every time we fly with Air France.","2019-10-10"
"4","There was no premium economy option available. The flight was full.  The crew did well at managing a motley assortment o","The staff were courteous,helpful and professional.  The legroom isn't optimal but better than alot of others.  It was on time. The snack was not up to their standard but edible  The pilot landed very gently.  Overall a pleasant experience.","2019-10-10"
"5","Good flight.","A connecting flight from Berlin, great service and a very comfortable plane. Plenty of legroom. On arriving back in Manchester they told us our luggage was still in Paris.

No problem, it was delivered to our home address when it came on the next flight. Excellent service.","2019-10-10"
"1","A flight of surprises.","I flew with AF from.CDG to TLS. 27sep AF7522.

First of all, cabin crew should be less arrogant and improve their English instead of giving an attitude:you are not in a fashion show...you work for an airline.
My surprise was that my luggage arrived pealed, crashed and with two holes. I went to AF lost&Found desk at TLS airport and two AF witches did not want to open a PIR for my luggage repair as they were saying that my luggage is ok. Never again in my life I will fly with AF. I had a cheaper flight with Easyjet but I said to myself that flying with Air France would me more helpful in case of ""irregularities"". Obviously not! The mentality and attitude of these members of AF staff at Toulouse airport was so unacceptable and not prepared to work for such global carrier like AF... and please... improve your English! 
The result of all this: I need to spend 160eur for a new luggage.. flying with AF is not so convenient! 
Disgraceful","2019-10-09"
"5","Helpful staff","After 3 weeks in Europe we started out journey home flying from Barcelona, Spain to Paris, France.  The last couple days of our trip my wife had some pain in her leg from a pinched nerve.  We asked for wheelchair service when we arrived at the airport and Air France along with Delta Airlines on other legs provided such excellent service I just had to mention it in a review.  The agents that helped were very friendly and did a wonderful job transfering us along the way.  It was like having a guide in each airport.  Also found Air France to have clean planes, on time service and unexpected meals like on our two hour flight from Baracelona to Paris.  I wasn't expecting much but they provide sandwiches and cookies and drinks.  However they did not have entertainment options on the flights to other european union cities we travelled to.  Overall I would recommend them.","2019-10-09"
"4","Not bad overall","We were flying with transfer in Paris. To our great pleasure all flight were on time at the day of our travel. However, I was monitoring similar flights a month in advance and majority of flights were delayed. If our flight were delayed, we wouldn’t make it to transfer. 
The food was outstanding. In economy class the food was accompanied by a complimentary champagne, wines and digestives of a choice. Very nice!
The crew was nice, except on one leg. As everywhere else, all depends on people. 
Overall we had a very positive experience.","2019-10-09"

"5","Excellent service and kindness of the staff","I was so impressed with this crew and plane. I was gifted smiles, endless amounts of water (which I needed), I was cheered for going into my competition by a crew of friendly and professional people. It was confortable, clean, on time and the movie selections were very good. I will definitely fly again with them.","2019-10-09"
"2","it should be better","I flow from Lima to Paris on economy class and I wasn't happy about the flight because; the aircraft is very old, seat is not comfortable and you feel that your sitting on a meatlice chair. The entertainment screen is very small and screen quality is very poor. it remind me with the they just introduce screens seat to aircraft in the 1990s. In 13 hours flight you expect 2 meals and snack. Yes there were 2 terrible meals and the food quality is not that good, but there wasn't any snacks offered even the flight attendance never walked in the cabinet to offer water of juices in between meals services.
If you want to drink something you should walk to the surface area and ask for it.","2019-10-08"
"4","could be worse","i did not have an aisle seat and was stuck between neighbours. 3 times the red light went on and i had to wait till it was replaced by a green light so i could go to the lavatory","2019-10-08"

"3","Problems with bookings, but good flights","Made a online booking for 5 people on a summer promotion. Halfway through the process the system did not allow the rest of the group the promotional price.  We had to pay with eft. On those eft bookings we didn't get flight reminders, check in reminders, mails to offer us upgrades, nothing. However the service was good once we got to the airport and on the flight. Our choice of meals was not available. cabin crew was friendly and helpful. Aircraft seemed in good condition.","2019-10-08"
"5","Comfortable Journey","Very comfortable flight.  Our flight left on time, very comfortable seating, and a delicious dinner with complimentary champagne & wine.  A large selection of movies, tv shows, music, etc. to occupy our time with high quality, complimentary ear phones.
Sufficient rest rooms in the cabin.  Courteous air plane staff.
Same goes for our return flight to the States.
...getting around De Gaulle airport for connecting flights is a subject for another day.","2019-10-08"
"1","Trip on Air France","First time I‘ve flown on Air France in many years. It’s a shame that the airline has gone downhill so much.  Flight attendants ( for the most part) were  fine and mostly pleasant.  
The food was TERRIBLE.  The only reason we were on this flight is that AF is a Delta partner.  I would avoid if at all possible!","2019-10-08"
"3","Disappointing Flight","very uncomfortable small seat. Wheel chair ordered never appeared. Male attendant in business not helpful with overhead luggage. Lady attendant saved the day by helping passenger store bag in overhead. Wheel chair also did not arrive at disembarkation","2019-10-08"
"1","Avoid A380 flights because of crowd poor quality meal and service","You should try to avoid A380 as possible. I flew many times with A380 Air France and nothing new there. A380 always brings over 500 passengers that are flocking into jumbo plane A380. There I faced bad experience: poor quality service, disgusting terrible meal, sicko breakfast with corn muffin, and bad outdated entertainment system. Crew members whispered me that A380 does not give better experience at all. There Air France downgraded meal quality to save money after repetitive protests. Inflight quality service control is lost and downgraded forever! Air France lost face and legacy!","2019-10-08"
"1","French grandeur is just a past memory","The airplane was extremely dirty. There were crumbs everywhere in the floor and trash left from I don't know who. Toilets were not well cleaned. This is really unacceptable for a 13 hours flight for which you pay tons of money. Hostesses seemed peeved and forced to do what they were supposed to do in a nice way. And by the way my monitor did not work. The outbound flight had 2 hours delayed but since they sent an email several hours before we could not ask for a reimbursement. And last but not least I found my baggage damaged in Paris. For the price you pay there are really better companies nowadays.","2019-10-08"
"5","Always exceptional comfort and service.","There is no American carrier to compete with Air France.  The customer service is exceptional. Attendants are gracious and no request overlooked. Always a pleasure to fly with.","2019-09-23"
"1","Similar to a low cost airline. For 2 kg they made my 12 hours flights horrible.","Because I exceeded of 2 kg my hand laguagge, the arrogant clerk with his supervisor made my trip a nightmare.

"4","Flight company to follow","This flight was much better than the Houston to Paris (CDG) 10 days ago on September 10. The food was OK but not like some years ago. The flight attendant was nicer than on the first way.
We enjoyed the trip, and I think Air France become one of the best flight company operating in USA. The only problem was that I found my suit case broke when I picked it up at the luggage carousel, one wheel was missing and I had a big hole at the place.","2019-09-22"
"4","Good flight","I took the flight from Dublin to Beijing, I transferred at CDG, it is a large airport with lots of shopping options. The flight was very smooth, it was a very nice trip. On board food and service was great like always.","2019-09-22"
"4","Pleasant short flight","Good short flight but expensive for such trip. However Air France is doing lots of improvements and I have found lately that the service is getting much better. I remain faithful to the brand","2019-09-21"
"4","smooth and reliable","we enjoyed our flights to and from Italy aboard Air France.  We booked economy plus, a little more expensive than coach, but worth every penny. Flight attendants were gracious and helpful, and the entertainment system was spot on.  Plus the preflight safety announcement was a hoot!  Seriously. I shot a video to keep.","2019-09-21"
"5","Business Class is the only way to Fly for LONG flights","The flight attendants were a cut above regular flights on Air France. The service was excellent and the food was strange by American standards  but excellent and plenty  of it including hot towels  and snacks. The food was Guy somebody like Puck in USA lol

The sleeping quarters were pretty private and I slept most of the way after eating on the night flight but coming back was more difficult as we were flying in the middle of the day. I recommend the night flight.  Poof you are in Paris . Would use them again. The lounge area at LAX was good but the one a Charles De Galle not so good but better than sitting in an open area.","2019-09-21"
"1","missing baggage","I took the flight from IAH to CDG and then to Prague. Unfortunately, I found that my luggage was still in CDG when I arrive in prague. the luggage office said they will send back to me the next morning since it was still in CDG. However, i gave them a call at 10pm again asking about is my luggage arrived but they said it is still in IAH n it will arrive on Monday “after morning”. I am very disappointed with ur airline n service. Different stuff gave me different information. It totally ruins my vacations. I have no personal belongings at all. It’s only saturday and I have to wait until Monday? And what can I do now? I have flown with many airlines but it never happened before. It’s really upset me and very disappointed. This is the very first time for me to have this experience.","2019-09-21"
"4","London to Thailand","got a great price for a business flight, new dreamliner aircraft. The seat was fine with a full layflat bed, but no mattress offered. Entertainment system was also good with good selection of upto date movies. The food was very average with only 3 selections and no additional meals that could be prebooked. The Sky-team lounges were all very god as well.","2019-09-21"
"4","Good service and nice flight","Good flight from Marseille to Paris. Enough room and was very efficient. There was some confusion about how much it would cost for the extra suitcase but all was good in the end","2019-09-20"
"3","Delayed flight but the only hope out of West Africa","Packed flight- very much delayed with unsmooth check in- dont expect much from SL airport check ins. Air France staff there are ok and great to see the aircraft since it was a much needed way out.
It turned out to be a very badly delayed and long flight.
We made a drop in Guinea- that was ok apart from passengers getting into arguments then as we approach Morocco- the flight turned back to Senegal after a passenger got sick- sigh
by the time we landed in paris- everyone was exhausted","2019-09-20"
"4","Service good.  Prompt departure","From the US we flew Delta, and from Paris to Mumbai,  it was Air France.   Seats were good, bathrooms clean, aircraft clean and comfortable. Service impeccable.   Choice of movies not very good, moving plane details were also not working.  Food was ok.   Enjoyed my flight.","2019-09-19"
"5","Wonderful lie flat beds in individual cubbies!","If you want to be treated like you're royalty, you need to fly business class with Air France.  Their lounge in the Paris airport, with free food and drink, ""quiet"" rooms, showers, spa, etc., was absolutely wonderful.  The dinner we received in the Air France lounge in  Washington, DC airport Air was excellent. As soon as you board the plane, you start receiving amazing service! ","2019-09-18"

"2","What A Mess","Having previously flown to Europe on two occasions, using U.S.-based carriers, this time  we returned to the states on Air France. It was unquestionably one of my two worst flight experiences. The boarding gate was changed but we never heard any announcement, nor was there a message on the boarding gate monitor that it had been changed. 

At the new gate, the self scan kiosk for your boarding pass malfunctioned at least 1/3 of the time, which created chaos for what was a full flight. Passengers were allowed to queue up all the way down the boarding gantry but prohibited from boarding because the cleaning crew hadn't arrived to clean the plane after it's previous flight. They didn't know this before they began the boarding process?! As a result, departure was delayed thirty minutes, while we stood in the gantry.

Not quite midway into the flight, the entertainment screens on the chairs of the entire middle row of seats malfunctioned. As the initial reboot attempt failed, the entertainment system for all of the monitors had to be shut down for a system-wide reboot. End result: the entire middle seating row was out of service for nearly an hour.

There were also check-in problems with which I will spare you the details. All in all, flying on Air France was an extremely exasperating and unpleasant experience.","2019-09-18"
"5","La Premiere is the best, hands down. ","Flew round trip LAX to CDG on Air France in La Premiere for holiday. I was simply amazed, and now nothing else will do. 

The ground service is the best I have ever experienced. You are escorted everywhere, there are no lines, and no inconveniences. I was even escorted to the customs office in CDG to file my VAT reimbursement. 

You have to understand the La Premiere lounge: most things are not out for display. However if you ask the accommodating staff, anything will quickly be provided to you. I did not enjoy the Alain Ducasse menu in the lounge as I chose to eat on the plane (Michelin quality food in flight), but I enjoyed a lovely Burgundy wine and an excellent massage. I was then driven to my plane in a BMW 7-Series to (basically) a private jet bridge that was retracted as soon as I boarded. 

Onboard service and food are the absolute best. The staff take great pride in their La Premiere service and they should. It really is something special. I’m currently on a trip in Lufthansa First and wish I was on Air France. 

Treat yourself. ","2019-09-18"
"5","No nonsense but no luxury either","It does the job but in the name of efficiency, seats don’t seem to recline, even slightly and on the 3rd row. Strange breakfast for a 9:35 am flight: shrimps, salted cucumber and chocolate mousse. No fruit, no juice, no croissant. Just a madeleine! They probably mistook it for an Asian flight !","2019-09-18"

On board service was great like allways, food and french wine was very good and tasty.

Landing also was very smooth.","2019-09-17"

"4","A nice airline","I’ve had good experiences with Air France in the past but this one wasn’t that great. My checked bag was left behind in Vancouver and it was delivered next day evening after our arrival in Switzerland. The food and IFE system were mostly ok. Despite priority tag, my baggage for return flight was put on the conveyor belt at the very end.","2019-09-09"
"2","If things are good, they’re really good; if they’re bad they’re horrible!!","After postponing our flight for 8 hours and providing us with cookies rather than the meal I was promised in an email from the airline, they not only changed the equipment to a smaller plane, but, changed the gate AND terminal.  At Charles de Gaulle, that required all 400 of us to go through another security check.  Since the plane was down-sized, it was inevitable that many wouldn’t have their tickets honored.  
At the new gate, we were met by two airline reps to handle our issues.  Overnight lodging was offered an hour and a half away from CDG,  However, my party needed to be in the states the next day for business purposes so we needed to fly.  Our premium seats were downgraded to economy and the only economy left for us were in the very rear of the plane.  We arrived in DC over 8 hours after scheduled to find that at midnight, they barely staff the ICE area and we were in for over an hour wait there.
I do recommend booking Air France flights through Delta, tho, as we had because Delta went overboard to provide us with refunds and travel certificates for future flights.","2019-09-09"
"5","Very good service","I took the flight from Costa Rica to Paris and then to Cairo, the last one I used joon airlines and I really liked it. The service is quite focused on young people and everything is very clean. Airfrance itself has a very good reputation and its service along with the meals was great.","2019-09-09"

There is plenty of movies available including new ones which is great.

Food is good and plenty.

The only downside was the Paris -Dublin flight with a small Jet where we did not have to much space to seat especially i had an even bigger chap seating next to me 
.

Ps:if you want more alcohol you need to go and just ask or buzz the stewards.","2019-09-09"
"4","very good service and flight attendants","I've never flown on Air France before but since Westjet cancelled our flight because of the max 8 jets being grounded they switched us to Air France.

"4","Check your seats carefully","Flight from Paris was lovely in the air, but an agent booked me a window seat that wasn't a window - and I paid $50 for it! I was quite upset as I was hoping to see some of the sights on such a clear day. However the head flight attendant found me a seat in Premium Economy so I at least had a comfortable one but so disappointed not to be able to see out a window. On the leg from Mumbai to Paris there were all kinds of exciting vistas visible outside, but the Map app was not working so I had no idea where I was - a shame!","2019-09-09"

"4","Great flight, as usual...","Had a 3 o'clock flight from IST to CDG, and 36 hours later back the same way. New Istanbul Airport was a mandatory option, would have preferred good old Atatürk or our new favour Sabiha Gökçen, but could not get neccessary hours for the flight. New İstanbul Airport is too big and aesthatecally uninteresting, you loose too much time before and after the flight... Anyway, Air France was a safe bet as tought. The beautiful lady who printed my boarding pass offered to print my fliyng back pass too, which saved me time, thanks again. Flight on time, cold snacks as usual (nothing beats Emirates and Turkish Airlines on flight food), also everything OK with CDG arrival.","2019-09-09"
"3","Challenges with connecting flights at CDG airport","The flights to and from CDG airport in Paris were enjoyable but due to the long lines and disorganization of the CDG airport, we nearly missed our connection while having nearly 2 hours from landing to departure. When we arrived at the gate, there was a lot of disorganization and confusion among staff through the boarding process. Unfortunately, our checked luggage did not make the flight from CDG to MSP and it has been 2 days without it. Fortunately, MSP was our home destination so it was a moderate inconvenience. My advice when having connections through CDG is to give yourself at least 3 hours between connections to minimize the hassle and possibility of your luggage not traveling with you to your final destination.","2019-09-09"
"2","3 hours late","Me was later from Shanghái, when we arrive to Paris we was going in the plane round the airport during 30 minutes, so we only has 20 minutes to pass all controls (also passport). When me arrived to the boarding gate the fly was dilated but they didn’t announced in the time tables. Son we had to wait in the door during tree hours to hear (in French and English nos Spanish) at what hour and in which door  we have go go. Incredible tree hours waiting instead outing it at the screen","2019-09-09"
"4","Good","Everything ok, but personal was not helpfull or kind. Fly in time. In A 16 hours fly it should be a drink service but there were not and if you ask for something they look at you in a bad mood","2019-09-09"
"5","First Class Service ","Booked a flight from Perpignan to Paris CDG using HOP with a connecting flight to Heathrow using Airfrance as soon as they were available. I even got up at 4 a.m. to complete on-line check in. 

5 hours before we were due to fly, we received a text advising us that our flight had been cancelled. We rushed to the airport to find our flight on the departures board. Very confused. We didn't find an Airfrance desk so I tried ringing their UK customer services but the hour ahead meant they were closed.

Out of desperation, we went to the Airport Information desk where we were dealt with by the 2 most helpful ladies. The flight wasn't cancelled, they had to use a smaller aircraft so we were effectively bumped off (probably  because we are English). Theytried their hardest to get us on the next available flight to CDG but they were all full.

They arranged for us to get on the next flight from the nearest airport Montpellier. A taxi paid for by Airfrance took us to Montpellier. We knew that time was going to be tight and unsurprisingly we missed the flight. 

We did find an Airfrance desk and they wete extremely helpful. They tried all sorts to get us back to CDG but the only flight meant we would of missed our flight back to the UK. We were put on a flight to Paris Orly which would give us plenty of time to get between the airports.

Flight was on time but it took over an hour for our baggage to arrive. We had 1 hour and 15 minutes before check in closed with a journey of anywhere up to 1 hour and 30 minutes.  Traffic was awful but our taxi driver got us to CDG by 3.05, just 15 minutes before check in closed. 

By the time we had located check in and got there, time was running out. I ended up queue jumping and was directed to the right place. Of course, we hadn't checked our luggage in so
we couldn't check in. We explained our day of travel and we were checked in without any fuss.

We just got through Passport Control and Security just in time to get through boarding.

We jested to the guy sat next to us that we'd had an awful day and the last straw would be lost luggage. Pleasant flight with drinks and an ice lolly. 

We were just getting to baggage when I received a text from Airfrance advising that one of our pieces of luggage was still in Paris.

By this stage, we were almost suffering with hysteria and we couldn't stop laughing. Lost luggage was easy and it was delivered the following day to our home.

Despite an extremely stressful day, everyone we came across couldn't do enough to help us get home. At no point, were we made to feel that we were a problem. I remember a flight from the same airport being cancelled to Manchester by Ryanair and they were not anywhere near as helpful or accommodating. 

We would definitely use Airfrance again.

"5","Vivien and family—  Air France flight  to Quito","We took a direct flight with Air France  from Paris to Quito in late June. i must admit  that we had started out on our very long trip with a feeling of slight trepidation.
It was a 12-hour flight,  but from the moment we boarded the plane, we felt  so well- pampered  by the Air France staff that it turned out to be  a relaxing stress- free trip on all counts. 
The seats in business class offer a reasonable amount of privacy. .They also recline almost flat,  and we were able to get a good sleep for part of the way. While we were awake, however, we were treated to some excellent French food and wine. The service and presentation were also top class.
Apart from  lunch and dinner, we were offered drinks,  tea, ice cream etc.,while we also availed ourselves of the onboard entertainment on our indifvidual screens.

We were very pleased indeed to arrive in Quito feeling quite refreshed and looking forward to our holiday in that beautiful country.
I would certainly fly Air France business class again, especially on similar long-haul trips.","2019-09-09"
"1","Worst Airline in Europe and Horrendous customer service. Would give 0 if I could","I flew from CVG to CDG with Delta, however, booked through Air France. My flight was delayed a couple of hours but the Delta staff were amazing and unbelievably helpful.

Coming into land at CDG I was alittle apprehensive about missing my connection to Manchester, I checked the Air France app and it was as though my connection had disappeared. Delta checked on board and said there was nothing about a connection on the system. When we were coming into land it had reappeared but instead of my original seat and take off time it had been changed to a later flight and no seat. It turned out it was the same flight, however, it too had been delayed a couple of hours. 

Once at CDG I went straight through security as I was told my flight was delayed till 1:30pm but I had to go to the desk to get a new seat as mine had been given to someone else. I thought I would head straight down to the gate before going to get a drink. it was currently only 9:30am, I got to the gate and was told my flight was no longer delayed and I had missed it. I went to the customer service desk and told them about my delayed flight along with a number of other passengers who were in the same position. 

I was given a new flight for 12:50pm, while I was at the desk I told the customer service assistant I was worried about my luggage as it was still tracking on the delta flight and hadn’t been removed. He said it was fine and would be on my flight at 12:50pm.

I sat at my gate waiting and as the gates were opening I asked the assistant if my luggage was on the flight as it was still tracking on the Delta plane. She went to check and said there was no luggage on the flight under my name but to check with the flight attendant  once on board. I asked on board and was told they would check, he came back to me telling me there was no luggage for me on this plane, however, proceeded to tell everyone around me how lucky they were to have their luggage on board while I was trying to ask him questions about finding my luggage. He just shrugged at me and walked off. 
The flight was delayed but not by much and we took off to Manchester we were, however, diverted to Birmingham airport to refuel this added on another hour to the journey. Once off the plane I went to the lost luggage department and filled out all the paperwork. I also emailed a Delta red coat as I wasn’t holding out much hope Air France were going to do anything, within a few minutes the Red Coat has replied and said he had made a call to aCDG red coat and he was looking for it. I got another email from him saying it was found. I had heard nothing from Air France or from the luggage handlers by this point. 

Once Air France the luggage time got back to me they said it would be at Manchester for 8:50am the next day. I heard nothing from them so gave them a call around 11am and they told me it didn’t actually make that flight and would hopefully be at Manchester for 1:30pm. I got an email saying it would be delivered to my house ASAP. I called Air France and told them the address and they confirmed it. At 12:40am I got a call from the delivery driver saying he was close by but had a different address it was 1:20am when he arrived at my house and so I just grabbed my luggage thanked him and went to back to bed. 

I went to do my washing and just looked at my cases. My big one was half open, had been smashed in places and was needing a bin, my blue one was better but it had rubber stuck to it and also had something spilt down it. No biggie a case can be repaired if everything inside is okay...... well my bag had watermarks, my dress was torn, my camera case was very dirty/ muddy and finally my poor shorts had been destroyed. 

I called Air France and submitted an online complaint with lots of photos, this was on the 1st August 2019. I did not hear back from them at all. I called and now have an additional £36 charges on my phone bill and they just said someone will email you at some point. I sent them messages on twitter asking from them to reply and I sent a number of emails. I have no heard back at all.

To recap my experience: delayed flights should have landed at 10:45am in Manchester and didn’t get there till 4:40pm. They lost my luggage, they ruined my cases, they damaged my clothes and they did not respond and ignored my complaint.","2019-09-03"

The mist glaring issue is the lack of internet - necessary for the business traveler today. The seats are little tired looking and the cabin is outdated.

The food was good and the service was very attentive.","2019-09-03"

Asked to talk to AF Quality Head Manager.... What's his name was operator reply....
I wasn’t able to speak to anyone has their don’t respond to the phone.

I requested to speak to some one from their quality department.
Once again unable to do so.

Before hanging up I told her Thanks and Bye Bye.

Found Air Chance (air france) quality manager name on the web
Pierre GIRAULT.

I Called AF HQ 03.09.2019 at 09h57 4 minutes call    recorded call

Got the same clerk, when I asked her to speak to Mr. Girault, she told me that
I’m the one whom just called in and hung up on her.
I told her if saying Thanks and Bye Bye, it’s called hanging up rudely…. What was her?
Attitude called then.

Once again impossible to talk to some one at Air France.

Quality and good behaviors seems to be banned from their skills.

Good look to anyone flying with them on long haul.","2019-09-03"

"1","Discrimination of young children","After today's flight am seeking ways how to open a discrimination case against Air France. This is the second time we fly with the son of 3 years on the route Paris - Mexico City, and the second time we have the incident of this type with them. This time I will proceed. It is not just the poor quality of service and non-professionalism of the crew, it is an active position of the company against children on board, seeing and treating them and their parents not as clients but as a pain in the ass, and taking on control function instead of providing any kind of adequate services that are normal for other companies. Ignorance is the keyword there.","2019-09-02"

This was my first and last trip with Air France the dude ALLAN GARCÍA at IAH real bad he thinks he owns Air France he really don’t  know how to treat passengers he charged us baggage allowance for no reason saying u have a different ticket in fact we had paid nothing when we were traveling from Mumbai to IAH and he charged me $220 saying u got Lucky out there As they did not charged me over there it’s an international flight we had just 3bags between 2 passengers 18kg each Guys please pay extra and go for Emirates and Qatar in fact even Turkish Airlines but hell to the no!! No Air France","2019-09-02"
"5","Great experience!","We had the chance to upgrade from Business to La Premiere, we went for it and it was totally worth it, especially on this 12 hour flight! Pick-up at the flight arriving in CDG by private car, driven to the La Premiere lounge and then directly to the airplane from CDG (A380), including personal pick-up at destination. The lounge experience was fantastic, food was like in a very good restaurant, all stress and worry free (quick security and formalities check with zero queues also at boarding). Even if the La Premiere suites in the plane are not the newest and are open suites it was totally private and calm (only 9 seats in La Premiere vs. 80 in Business on A380). Outstanding service on board, great vanity kit and pyjamas and perfect food, plus non-stop La Grande Dame 2006 Champagne if you are so inclined, after already having Pol Roger in the lounge. Overall a great experience!","2019-09-02"
"5","Stylish, with excellent catering","Flew on their new Business Class on the B777-200. Everything went very smoothly and the service was excellent. The reverse herringbone seats are spacious and comfortable, with quite a lot of room for your feet even when fully flat. Ample storage space. 

The catering was excellent, particularly the lunch service. I like the fact that, rather that making a choice of appetizer, you get several small portions. (Same with the dear dessert.) The service was efficient without being rushed, and all flight attendants were extremely professional and friendly. (Breakfast was a bit less opulent, but the flight times were such that most people would want to sleep for as long as possible.) 

IFE is fine - enough things not to get bored although the TV selection could be a little better perhaps.","2019-09-02"
"1","What a nightmare","We booked our return flights from Budapest to JHB. We arrived with more than enough time for check in and we were third in line. When we got to the front they said no we cant be on our flight as we will not make the connecting flight to SA and thus we must be booked on another flight. They sent us to another counter and booked us on a BA flight. When we got to the BA check-in they said sorry its closed. So we had to go back, they tried to book us on a turkish airway flight, but there was only space for 1 person instead on 3. So they said no they will book us into a hotel then we fly the next day, but they quickly changed their minds(we believe because they did not want to spend money on hotel etc.). So they booked us back on our original flight but we lost our pre booked seats and sat in the worst seats ever. We had to run across Paris airport to make the next flight. Then when we got here, our bags never arrived. Worst experience ever, will never recommend this to anyone","2019-09-02"

"3","Missery and champagne ","My Direct flight with KLM was canceled and I got rebooked on the Air France to Paris. Then Paris-Amsterdam. 
I was able to upgrade to business class, since this Airbus 380 has plenty of business seats on the upper deck. Best move I made that day. Waiting to take off, the pilot asked if a doctor was on board. We returned to the gate, luggage had to be taken off. Two hour delay!
I was so happy to be able to walk around. But being at Dulles, no champagne was flowing. Food arrived late, the beef was tough, I could not eat it. The lobster appetizer was two bites, so we’re the deserts. 3 bites. Select the chicken!!! The champagne was very good and the cheese saved my day. 
I also ate my cheese sandwich, which I had brought with me. 
The staff was very friendly, but I was never able to work out the video system, they couldn’t either.
I had 45 minutes to make my next flight, luckily I hooked up with a couple with a wheelchair. Mine, which I ordered, was not there. 
The airport is a maze, you do need an hour and a half to find your way. 
A nightmare if you are alone. 
The flight was was smooth in this big airplane, unfortunately someone got sick, not their fault. But the food was a big disappointment!

"5","A great experience ","Everything went very smoothly with our flight to Los Angeles. The staff were courteous and efficient, they were able to speak several languages and never looked put out if people asked anything.
Flight was smooth, seats pretty comfortable and legroom fine.

Would definitely fly air France again for long or short haul. ","2019-08-31"

"4","Flying to San francisco","My flight from Paris ti sa /francisco was very good.  we had already connected from and air france flight in Naples to Paris and because it was a little late leaving Naples, we had almost no time to get to the part of the airport that our transcontinental rental flight awaited us.  Fortunately we made the connection.  The flight was good and uneventful but the landing was a little sketchy.  We did finally land without incident. Therefore, I have to say the flight went fine.","2019-08-31"
"4","A380 Upper deck, Mexico City - Paris","I paid a little extra to book a ""preferred seat"" (90D), so I could have extra legroom, and in the beginning I found it excellent. Since this is an exit row for a huge airplane, there is plenty of space in front of you (the tray table is inside your amrest).

However, to my surprise, this seat does not have an USB power connection, even if it is more expensive than a normal Economy ""packed"" seat (which have the power outlet in the tv screen set). There might be technical reasons for this, but I find this unacceptable in 2019. An 11-hour flight is very suitable to use our own devices, but without AC power this becomes very annoying. The solution? Find an empty seat and leave your PC charging there hoping that nobody will touch it.

In my case however (and this is the reason for the 4 stars), I could move to two empty seats (92K and 92L), thanks to the suggestion from the crew (there were other people asking to be moved, but my gold card helped)
One tip: On the Upper Deck (Economy Class), the seat configuration is 2-4-2, with a lot of space between the window seat and the window itself. An ideal place to travel alone or in couple.","2019-08-30"
"4","Great flight!","Every year we visit Lebanon and for these past few years been flying with Air France. I always chosen the flight with more than 18 hours layover in Charles De Gaulle airport. I don’t really have anything bad to write about Air France, it’s a flight that get to our destinations. We’ve always fly premium economy, so we have more space than regular economy class.","2019-08-29"
"2","Not kid-friendly and outdated","We are a young family and flew internationally twice with Air France in the past 3 months:  Atlanta to Paris to Moscow, and back.  Extremely disappointed with their product, especially for families with kids.  Here's why:

1.  A 3 hr. 45 minute flight from Moscow to Paris had no TVs for kids to watch.  
2.  The Atlanta to Moscow flight did have TVs, but they were very blocky and outdated and you had to almost punch the screen to get them to work.
3.  ***At both starting destinations, the Air France gate representatives took our stroller and made us check it to our final destination (we have a 1 yr. old), insisting we would find kid strollers in Paris to use.  I've never experienced that with any airline, how that can possibly be acceptable in 2019 is beyond me, to make parents carry their 1 yr. old along w/ other kids and luggage the whole way.  We never found an airport stroller on our 1st flight in Paris to use, and the 2nd time in CDG, eventually found one after clearing security but walking a super long time carrying our son.  There were other families along w/ us who were equally shocked about it.  This is customer service at its lowest, to make life more difficult for parents w/ young kids.

Service on the plane itself was good, but other than that, we won't be flying Air France again......","2019-08-15"

"4","Air France Stewardesses the best","On our return to the US, we had the good fortunate to be upgraded to Premium Economy. Our 11-hour nonstop flight was actually pretty comfortable. Our young granddaughter had a terrible nosebleed mid-flight, and it frightened her a little. The Air France stewardesses were very professional, and helped her staunch her nosebleed while reassuring her all the while. And they were attentive to her for the rest of the flight. While transatlantic flight is almost always an endurance test, the women on this flight took good care of us, and that made all the difference.","2019-08-13"
"5","Wonderful experience and great service","The A380 Is a wonderful plane : spacious even in economy class, very comfortable, very quiet. We had a plane delay between Miami and Atlanta due to a storm at Miami which would have made us miss our connection if Air France had not been waiting for us sothat we could get our connection to Paris. The plane was on Time at Paris.  Our luggage did follow despite the very short time. The staff was very nice and helpfull with every one, doing their best to make our journey a great moment. Food was good. We are happy for choosing Air France. Thank you for having waited for us. Very proud that you represent France all over the world.","2019-08-13"

Only reason for 4 stars not 5 food sucks!!! Oh my lord, we were lucky we brought our own sandwiches from the airport otherwise honestly could have gone hungry! 
For me not a deal breaker though, I usually don’t expect much from airline food service but Aeroflot by far is better in that category.","2019-08-13"
"1","THE WORST!!! My advice go with a different airline.","The worst plane I've ever traveled with. They lost both luggages and they are not doing anything about it. I literally called every number I was given or found online. It's hard to reach them on the phone and once they finally do answer they either speak only french or it's not the right department. Mind you I paid extra $388 for those checked luggages on top of my plane ticket. It's not like they are sending them for free. From Boston to Paris the luggages were sent just fine. Once they arrived to Paris CDG they stayed there because the plane was full. From what I understand they were supposed to send them on the next flight coming to Casablanca. It's going to be more than a week and still nothing came. They can't even locate them anymore.","2019-08-13"
"1","NEVER TAKE AIR FRANCE-YOU WILL NEVER SEE YOUR LUGGAGE AGAIN!!!!","Terrible customer service they lost my luggage and they will not help you locate it. The lazy employee's make you wait in long lines while they chat and drink coffee. My flight from Lyon to Paris a one hour trip, they lost my bag with my husband High Blood pressure medication, designer clothes, gifts from Harrods in London gone and no one is  looking for it. Asked employee in Paris respond "" I can't help you, use the machine and put a claim in"" I have called lost luggage phone # 10 times recording "" high volume calls at this time please try later"" click.

"1","Dreadful!","After travelling around Peru, this beautiful country with delightful people, and making our way home, we had a horrible experience with the Air France staff in Lima during the check-in. An unexperienced young woman that didn’t speak a word of French neither English treated us in an intolerable manner. When asked to talk to the manager, they order us to take our suitcases from behind the counter and they threaten us to call security otherwise. We felt intimidated as her other colleagues saw us in desperation and did nothing! We waited and waited and waited for the manager, he or she never came.  All the contrary, we went to Peru with KLM and everything was just great.  This experience has been traumatic for us and for sure this will be the last time we travel with Air France.","2019-08-12"

Secondly the Media system did not work and it took nearly 2hours and half into my journey to get a response.  Furthermore nothing was fixed I had to sit there with no form of media. This was a flight that the flight crew does not gave a clue about customer service. I will no recommend this airline and will try my best never to use this airline.","2019-08-11"
"3","Portugal/Spain Trip","My family and I flew AirFrance for our Portugal/Spain Trip. We flew from Boston to Porto, Portugal first. The check-in process was smooth. The service/food is average like any other airline. Layover was in Paris that was fine as well. Both flights were on-time.

On the way back we flew from Madrid, layover in Paris, and arrived back home in Boston. Check in-process was also smooth but there was delay of an hour and half. They started to call groups to start boarding, only to have us all wait in line for an hour. That was annoying. Other than that, service was fine.","2019-08-11"
"1","Last choice after this experience","I understand some circumstances are out of our control but between the rude employees at the gate, 30 minute delay to get a deceased persons bag off, causing a late departure and arrival at the other airport in which I narrowly made the gate and top it off one of my bags was left in Paris. Flight from Paris to Dallas the thermostat was very warm and unpleasant. Also the flight tracking on the monitor wouldn’t ever come up, so kept guessing where and how long we had left. ","2019-08-11"
"3","On time departure and arrival -- average cabin service","We were in Premium Economy in a triple 7 aircraft. Plane was fully booked, the usual hassle and chaos during boarding. 
Crew appeared not to be too motived during this flight; service was the bare minimum.
Leg room is good in Premium Economy, the ergonomics of the seats for a passenger 6 ft tall are not that good. I could not find the right position to fall asleep, which I normally do not have a problem with. Back of the seat can moved very little, no difference of coach class (while the width of the seat definitely is). 
On-flight entertainment offering is good. 
Cleanliness of cabin as well.
A very average flight experience.... it's ok, not more and not less.","2019-08-11"
"3","Air France-not what I expected","Since we were flying to Paris, we decided to try Air France, thinking we would get good food and a relaxing flight.  It didn’t happen.

I would fly them again.","2019-07-27"
"1","Pathetic check-in process ","Air France did it again ! After having completed the passport form, contact details, I AGAIN received the „invitation“ to pick up the boarding pass at the CROWDED and UNDERSTAFFED Check In desk at Hamburg airport. 

No one can explain what the problem is, but there obviously is one.  

I can / will not recommend Air France. The inflight experience is not nice, last time I flew this route in Business Class and noticed the VERY little legroom you even have in a, so called, Premium Class. 

 Customer experience starts before boarding the aircraft!","2019-07-27"
"1","Worst airline ever. Worst flying experience ever","Don't EVER fly with Air France. We were flying with my all service dog in the cabin from Madrid to Paris. First of all, emotional support dogs are supposed to fly for free but they don't in Air France. We paid, and it was not cheap. Second, we had stated many days before that we were flying with a service dog and they said ok. The day of the flight, we went to do the check-in at the airport and they told us we had not stated that we were flying with a service dog. Then, on the flight, flight attendants were very rude. Every flight I have ever been in with my service dog, they let me take him out of the carrier and let him sit on top of me and sleep there. But not here. They came and told me to put him back in the carrier and then proceeded to try to take it away from way with my dog in it very aggressively and violently. The flight attendant, which was a guy, was pulling my dog away from me. If I had not pulled back, he would have taken my dog away from me I don't know where. At the end of the flight, we went and talked to the pilot. He apologized saying they didn't know he was a support dog. They did know. We had told them. Don't ever fly with them. I know I will never again.","2019-07-27"

Waited 6 hours in line to be booked on another horrible flight. They didn't even offer snack or water vouchers. All employees have no sense of urgency and were literally having side conversations while a line of people looped around the whole airport. The flight was stuffy and smells like fart. 
Such a disappointment! Never flying AirFrance again!!","2019-07-26"
"1","Horrible Customer Service and worst Airline","I have a scheduled trip for my family from India to USA on July 23 and the flight is from MAA to ORD via Delhi & Paris. The ticket was booked and when my family tried to check in at the MAA airport, the person at the check in said we have to get our baggage at Delhi airport and re-Check-in at Delhi. I asked them it is a single journey &why should i recheck-in and they said it is Air-France issue as my domestic flight was through Air-India even though the ticket was booked through Air-France website as a entire journey. So i did recheck-in & asked the Air-France check in at Delhi about the baggage and Air-France said that ""Oh, Air-India and Air-France has a tie up and we don't know why Air-India said that. Please ask Air-India about that"". That's how they care about us. We landed at Paris airport and had a wait time of 9 hours and hence i decided to get the Lounge service at the airport as stated on their website that it can be accessed for a fee of €50 per person. When i reached them and asked for the Lounge access, Air-France said that your wait time is too long and we cannot give you the Lounge access as Air-France expects more people to access the Lounge. I didn't understand what the heck they are speaking, all they want is people with shorter wait time to access the Lounge so that they can make more money. That's how the Air-France works that they want to make more money or discriminate people that you don't qualify for the class to access the Lounge.","2019-07-26"
"5","Great flight!","I have flown this flight a few times.  It is the double decker plane.  I have no complaints.  I like flying Air France.  You get a menu for dinner and that includes free alcholic drinks (both to and from the U.S.) no matter what class of service you are flying.  During the flight, after food is served there is also a beverage ""station"" where they have a help-your-self type choice of drinks.  The staff is friendly and the overhead bins are big.  

I traveled with a group of students this time, so I had to sit in economy.  The leg room was fine.  Luckily, I didn't have anyone next to me and I could use that space too.  I have also flown this flight in premium economy and the legroom was more spacious.  

The entertainment wasn't as good this time around in my opinion.  I didn't see anything that I would want to watch.  However, that may be different for you.

I am so intrigued by flying on a double decker airplane.  It's like a massive building in the air.  I like how the plane has three cameras on the outside of it where you can see yourself landing, taking off and flying in the air.

I recommend this flight and Air France.","2019-07-26"
"5","Awesome flight ","This was the only international flight I have ever taken where I was extremely comfortable in Economy!!! I got the last two seats row 52, A and B for my husband and I and it was the most amazing seats! They had both windows which were instructed, they had personal TVs with fantastic movies and entertainment in general. We were given headsets, eye covers and blankets and pillows. The crew was amazing on July 25 at 10:10 flight and we arrived in Houston 30 min early! I have never flown with Air France but I have already recommended and will fly with fly with them in the future ","2019-07-26"
"2","Strictly travel","When you are traveling, the only thing that matters is comfort from your little cramped up Economy seat, trying to make the best of the available space.
I setup all possible alarms to check in online to get hold of the best possible FREE seat in the flight and Vola, I get the Exit row Window seat. My smiles were from ear to ear as i was gonna have the best possible flight with all the possible leg room. I enter the flight and i could see my seat all empty decked up in colour BLUE. I grab my seat and you know the feeling where u think this is not going as per plan, not the best seat you could get with an alarm for early morning. I try and calm myself down but things had already taken a turn.
My seat had a diagonal wall coming inside which made me sit in a awkward tilt position. The back of the seat had metal poking into me with no cushion at all to cover the frame. When i asked the cabin crew, all they gave me a few more pillows so that i could rest my back on the chair with no comfort.
The toilets stink worse than most of public toilets which hardly get cleaned.
Apart from my seat being below average, everything else was average.
Except for the middle eastern airlines, all airlines are functional in terms of their duty to transport us from destination A to B leaving behind the luxury.
Air France was a bit short in terms of the attitude they carry for passengers in treating them WE DONT CARE if your seat is broken.","2019-07-26"
"3","Tight but still with some style","A bit worn fleet (inter-european flight) and with space between rows tighter than Ryan air! I'm not extremely tall, 1,85 m, and sit comfortably in Ryan air's ""buses"". Substanially less space for my legs on Air France...
Nevertheless, AF is one of the few ""state"" airlines left that tries to uphold some sort of service from the past.
A very cut down, but still sort of three courses, meal and drinks is offered even on short flights (here Paris-Stockholm). I respect that and just hope AF can keep it up.","2019-07-26"
"1","Lost luggage","Transit time from Split to CDG is around 2 hours to the next flight to Amsterdam and yet AF managed to not properly organised the transit luggage. I ended up with no luggage when i arrived back home. HORRIBLE","2019-07-25"
"1","Ancient Plane, Inedible Food, Lost Luggage","The 737 we flew looked like it had been built 50 years ago and should have been scrapped at least 20 years ago! The seats were so jammed together that we couldn't even cross our legs. There was only one bathroom for the entire coach section of the plane. The food was absolutely inedible. The gear made such a horrible sound the entire time it was raised and lowered that we feared it would either not lock in place or fall off entirely! One of our bags never got on the plane, even though there was a 4-hour layover, and it took them 5 days to get our bag to us! Upon delivery, the handle was broken, and the bag looked like it had been dragged through the mud!","2019-07-25"
"5","excellent flight","We flew air france on a recent international trip.  The quality of the service, inflight entertainement, food, selection of beverages was superb.","2019-07-25"
"1","Poor quality plane","The plane was of poor quality on the interior.
It was outdated, dirty, with dirt or gum residue beneath the seat arm rest 
It was very disappointing 
On the bright side the crew was very nice","2019-07-25"
"5","Great trip on the air!","I had a trip to Paris with my university in early 2019 and it was awesome for a long flight, about 12 hours.
Delicious meals, well-trained staffs and beautiful furniture.
World like to use it again!","2019-07-25"
"4","Enjoyed Cushy business class after chaotic boarding","The Business Class lounge was fantastic. We didn’t use the massage and spa services, but there were nap rooms and showers, and nicely equipped rest rooms. 

The food was decent and a full bar was available. Good beverage/espresso selection, also. All self service and complimentary. The seating options varied throughout the lounge; velvet banquettes, cafe tables, lounge chairs, etc.

The flight would have been much more enjoyable if the boarding hadn’t started with my husband’s boarding pass not working (after I’d already passed thru the gate with I realized he wasn’t with me).  I walked back to the counter and saw a large group of passengers having the same problem. No information was given to them. The scene was agitating because of the lack of information. I could see that they’d been pulled aside for a last minute security check, as there was a security table out of their sight right next to the boarding ramp. Passengers held there were worried and most were separated from their families. One teenage girl had been separated from her father, and she was in tears. Passports were taken from the passengers in this group, and they were taken 2-3 at a time to the random screening area for an explosive detecting hand wipe. Then their passports and boarding passes were given back to them.

We paid for business class, which should mean priority boarding, but my husband was last through this process. I was so worried that something was wrong with his boarding pass that I was afraid to board without him. So, even though I have a painful back problem, I stood with my carry-on and waited over 20 minutes to be sure everything went through. I was really anxious. So the start to our flight was HORRIBLE.

The business class pods were comfortable and clean. The seats laid fairly flat, and I was pretty comfortable. There is a cabinet to store items you want to access during the flight, and other considerate touches. The service on my husbands aisle (pods are one-two-one, so all  pods have aisle access) was excellent. I think they were training flight attendants on my side; I was several times passed over for beverages, bread, etc. 

The food was pretty good. Even the rolls were soft. The menu was pretty comprehensive for most tastes, and all courses were enjoyable. If I drank wine, I’m sure I would have enjoyed the selection.

The toilets remained clean and well stocked throughout the flight.

The entertainment system was EXCELLENT, with an adjustable pull out screen. There were movies from many countries with subtitles in many languages. My husband and I synced our screens and watched some great Korean historical action films together.

Air France business class gives a nice pair of slippers and a nicely designed neoprene bag with essentials, I’m still using it for other things.

Even if the security check pre-boarding wasn’t their fault, Air France personnel could have done a much better job communicating what was going on. 

In spite of this, I did enjoy my flight. I would fly Air France business class in the future, as long as I was on a plane equipped with pods.","2019-07-24"
"5","Competitive business class seating","Good and bad.  The good is that the food and the service is much better than some American airlines that I have experienced over the years.  The bad is that the business class seating does not fully recline, at least on the flight I took.  On the return trip took AF operated by Delta - business class seats fully reclined but the food/wine was not as good.","2019-07-24"
"5","Pay a little extra for Premium Economy!","The staff on our Delta/Air-France flight was very attentive and friendly. I observed the same quality customer service for everyone ranging from First Class to Economy. The attendants were very patient with our six year old who had to endure a very long flight. If you are travelling at night and believe you will sleep most of the way, economy will do. If you are travelling during the day and believe you will be awake most of the flight (and are with children), I recommend spending an extra $400 for Premium Economy.","2019-07-24"
"4","LAX > CDG","My first Air France flight on A380 jumbo jet #65.  All good , paid for economy preferred seat upstairs , was happy with seat and French cuisine and free wine and champagne.  No language barrier Although announcements were made in French first...only complwint was no WiFi for long flight. ","2019-07-24"

"5","Great Flights","We flew Air France from New York to Paris and then from Paris to New York. We also flew from Paris to Nice and back while we were on our trip. Myself and others in my party were very pleased with our flights and we recieved excellent service. The airport staff and the flight crew were all very helpful and friendly. We also flew Southwest from Austin to New York and back and recieved excellent service.","2019-07-11"
"5","Loved Air France","It’s a long trip from Phoenix to Paris and we opted to fly premium economy - more expensive, of course, but so worth the extra legroom for a long flight.  The food was the best I have add on a long flight and service was great.","2019-07-11"
"5","A very good impression on my first fligt with Air France","My flight with Norwegian was cancelled and they got me flights with Air France instead. I very much enjoyed the 2 flights (Oslo - Paris - Barcelona) and the crew was very professional and seemed to take passanger safety very seriously.","2019-07-11"
"4","Great comfort with family for vacation trip","This was a great flight, but we experienced some delay on departure due to late passengers. Altogether, this was a great experience for vacation and the whole family I had with me.","2019-07-11"
"5","OUTSTANDING!","Not since we've flown First Class on on domestic flight have we had such great food, service and ammenities as the ""Economy"" seats on this airline. We flew four times on our trip to France and every flight was outstanding. Food options were wonderful, and the servers very pleasant and efficient. Ammenities included were blankets, pillows, and ear pods for the marvelous screens which gave us choices of over 100 movies, music playlists, games, etc. ALL FREE even in economy class!","2019-07-11"
"5","Great flight but...","We flew back to the US after a Baltic Cruise vias Copenhagen and Charles DeGaulle. Both flights were ontime arrivals. CDG has a long passport control line in the middle of changing flights so we needed the 2 1/2 hr to make our connection. We flew to ATL on the huge A380. It takes at least an hour to board the over 400 people. The flight was excellent with good seats, great services, plenty of food and beverages and the bathrooms were always clean. Upon our arrival in ATL, there seemed to be chaos in the passport control space...too many people arrving at one time. Not Air France's fault.","2019-07-11"
"4","Mainly positive, with a few delays and adjustments","I was surprised when Air France suggested booking the flight from JFK to Marseille with only a 1 hour and 40 minute layover in Paris (CDG), but since they suggested it, I booked this option. The JFK flight was delayed by over two hours, meaning that we missed our connecting flight in Paris. They rebooked us on a flight leaving that evening from Orly airport, but Air France does not provide transit from CDG to Orly--you have to pay to get yourself from one to the other. I was disappointed that a delay caused by the airline was not met with better customer service. With that said, the flight was smooth and the staff helpful, and they invited me to apply for reimbursement for the bus from CDG to Orly, which we did, and we will see if they approve it. 

Overall, I like Air France and will fly them again, was just a bit disappointed in how much we had to search on our own to figure out how to get from CDG to Orly (it was hard to find Air France employees who knew the best way to do that) and the fact that their delay cost us more money.","2019-07-11"
"5","My recent flight to Paris","The trip was smooth and on time. No delay and good customer service . The flight crew attended to us cheerfully and with a smile.","2019-07-10"
"5","AF ,Bangalore to Paris","I flew on AirFrance from Bangalore to Paris on my way to Chicago in June.
I am a frequent flyer (FF)on AF, This was an unplanned trip and so i had to buy a premium economy ticket as the business class was too expensive. I had requested for an Indian vegetarian meal and got it.
The cabin crew were very good, they acknowledged my FF status .
I got a good nights sleep although in a not flat seat.","2019-07-10"
"5","Surprised","I don't know why I was surprised, I just was.  The plane was clean, and the service was very good - warm, friendly and efficient.  The food was good and the seating comfortable (but a long flight, so I still hurt).  The lay-over was Paris.  Again, surprised at how easy it was to get around, and they made sure we found our next flight.  With a 4 hour layover, we only had to kill time for just a little over an hour - worth it as my wife got to browse the shops.","2019-07-10"
"5","Air France - my best flight","Flew from Portugal to Johannesburg via Paris, I flew with my 82 yr old dad..which the assistance with my Dad was excellent, lovely flight, excellent assistance, would fly with Air France any time","2019-07-10"
"1","Luggage never delivered","I cannot believe how inept Air France has been with my luggage.

They had my itinerary many times during my month long stay in Europe. Hotel concierges called them speaking in French so there was no question as to where we were. Their delivery of “lost” luggage is appalling!

If you think I sound like another rich American, forget it... there were special clothes I bought just for this trip, walking shoes, hairbrush, curling iron, pajamas, raincoat for Ireland, warm fleece for cold winds, summer clothes for hot days, jeans, dresses, etc! My husband and I would wait around just in case they delivered it while in Paris. Who waits around in Paris? This was a once in a lifetime trip made very uncomfortable without the simple things in a 23” suitcase. 

We were always patient with Air France on the phone. I’m done being patient, I’m angry! I am also angry with Delta Airlines for partnering with Air France. Delta knows they have my suitcase and are disinterested in doing anything about it. 
","2019-07-10"
"3","No interest to priorities dropping out the luggages according to flight and hour flight","On Tuesday July 9th, it seems that there were many flights leaving around the same time (around 12 am), and there was a lot of people queuing. No preference was offered to passengers parting earlier than others. Everybody had to do the disposal of luggage at the same zones, without being given priority when you had your boarding card but not registered your luggage yet and having a flight due to shut in a short time.","2019-07-10"

"5","Best check-in experience ever by Patricia, great service by Benjamin....","I have had my share of ups and downs with Air France, in particular given some strikes (not their fault). 

Last week the check in process was my best ever in my long and wonderful life!!! Patricia at the business class check in in CDG was fabulous. Great sense of humor too. My son who is learning French enjoyed watching us talk. I wish I knew her last name to send her a compliment.

In the plane, also i noticed that each time i fly Air France, they are getting better  and better. Benjamin our cabin attendant (do not know his last name...his sister lives in Evanston!) was FABULOUS. He worked nonstop and was so attentive.

The plane was very clean. Configuration comfortable and felt open. Security videos charming. Food delicious.

Great job Air France. Merci Y'all!!!

"1","Worst comfort on a business class flight EVER","I have read that some low cost airlines in domestic US flights do not offer reclining backrests anymore. But I never expected this on a full fare, flag carrier business class flight. Staff was nice and courteous, food acceptable, but a business class seat with a fixed backrest? Come on.","2019-07-10"
"1","Check in experience in Paris","I just did my review on my experience from service on the plane from Paris to Houston which was absolutely  terrible. I forgot (how could I)  to mention  check in experience at the airport in Paris. We stand in line for hour and half before they let us to check our bag. Another line formed was for checking passports, where airline had only one person working, one window oppened! We had to wait 45 min. If you want to go to lounch, you had to go through security again ! Overall it was horrible!","2019-07-10"
"2","Inadequate help and professional service","As a family we have almost traveled the globe several times by now. Today daughter on flight out of Amsterdam to Bangkok via Paris 
Plane was 1hour and 5 minutes late taking off  as a result she was going to miss connection through.Time for the transcontinental connecting flight was already as tight as it could be if all had gone to schedule    Still she might have made  her flight  along with others due to make same connection but for the inadequate unhelpful and practically none existent help and information from both flight crew and later ground crew at CDG .  Misleading information and instead of flight attends asking everyone who has no connecting flight to remain seated in order for those already really late and worried to pick up hand baggage and leave first .  This caused yet another delay and once in the terminal it was as if everyone was off duty, not available and any signs had been hidden.Result she and others missed their connecting flights - some by minutes those minutes which could have been saved with really professional help and service minded attitude.","2019-07-10"

"4","The long-haul flight is pleasant but the shorter leg is subpar.","Great service overall, especially on the long haul flight.
The business lounge at CDG has very limited facilities and food options.
The shorter leg from London to Dublin is just normal - very much similar to a premium seat on a budget airlines which is a bit disappointing.","2019-07-09"
"4","Air France Is A OK","Air France is one of the best airline overall that we love flying.  Customer Service is good from  checking in up to the plane.  The flight is smooth.  The Flight Attendants are all very good in customer service.","2019-07-09"

Air France staff superb.i am glad we upgraded as it gave to access more comfort on a long flight.
Would certainly do so again on a long haul flight.","2019-07-09"
"5","First overseas flight","We were going on a Med cruise and couldn't afford business class so we opted for premium c\economy and were we surprised at the comfort of the seats which allowed us to get some sleep across the Atlantic.  Not knowing what to expect in the food and drink department we enjoyed the free wine, cocktails and soda as well as  dinners and snacks that rivaled meals we have gotten in business class trips taken after this one.  The premium economy seats and service on the connecting airlines were not even close to the comfort and service that Air France had.  I would only give them 3.5 stars.  I am now able to afford business class air travel so won't have the pleasure of experiencing the next step down again on Air France but have no reservations about recommending it to other travelers.  Even though the time traveled says Aug. 2018 it was actually Oct. 2012","2019-07-09"

After take off, Wrapped moist towels were passed out to everybody to freshen up. We were served a drink and small snack then lunch, which has really good. The chicken was more tender and tasty than I had had at the Moulin Rouge show in Paris the night before. Mid flight, everyone was offered an ice cream, then a supper was served. The inflight entertainment worked very well and I watched 4 movies during the long flight. Toward the end, the restrooms were a bit messy as one might expect after 10 hours of flying. It was one of my best flights.","2019-07-09"
"5","Excellent Service","I recently travelled with my sister to Central America.  She generously paid for the flight and holiday as a package.  We live in London, so we wanted a flight from Heathrow.  It appeared that there are no direct flights so the choice was to either travel to France, Spain or North America to change flights.  We chose to fly to France.

A few years ago we travelled internationally, economy, and went via Air France.  We were both impressed by the leg room in economy and the service, so chose Air France again.

We had a delightful experience with Air France.  The business class seats are extremely comfortable.  They provide privacy, easy access to the aisle, toilets and a sturdy footrest.  Although I like the business class in British Airways, I found the foot rests flimsy and unless seated in the aisle seat one was at the mercy of one's fellow passenger to lower their foot rest or climb over their feet to get to the toilet....not ideal and could cause an accident 

On Air France, we were provided with slippers, socks and generous wash bag that even contained a pen (very useful if one has forgotten to bring one and immigration visa forms are required for temporary entry into the host country), in addition to a blanket, headphones, bottle of water and pillow.  

The food was delicious and, again, generous.  Even on the flight from London to Paris we were offered a light meal!  There was plenty of choice, the meals were served individually and pipping hot once the starters were consumed instead of everything being presented all at once and the main becoming tepid.  The cabin crew were very generous with the beverages, both non alcoholic and alcoholic and with the bread or croissants.

The crew were very professional, welcoming, warm, attentive and approachable.  They seemed genuinely interested in passenger welfare, safety and comfort, made polite conversation during the service and individually thanked each of us before we landed for flying with Air France.  

I would highly recommend Air France, business class, for privacy, comfort and an excellent service.","2019-07-09"
"5","Fantastic service ","Air France, what can I say..
Brilliant, fantastic great service, very friendly, made to feel very comfortable and welcomed. The sandwich and coffee which was free was the best I have ever had on a airline and was also given a small bottle of red wine.
Cannot wait to fly back to France and will certainly use Air France.

"2","Great in flight service - horrible ground serivce","There is no denying that Air France service in the air is good. Having experienced in the past I was looking for this flight. Unfortunately, despite the decent seat, the good food and the decent service the ground service surrounding this flight was poor.

Let's start with the delay of 45 min - we all been there, delays happen. The issue is how you handle them. In this case, poor communication meant that boarding time had gone and passed before any communication was given, after everyone stand in line waiting for a long time. People were cutting the line left and right without rhyme or reason. Finally we were allowed to pass the automatic boarding gates, only to stand in line 10 meter after them for another 30 min.

But the real gem here was the luggage. Somehow they managed to lose the luggage despite the long delay. They do send a proactive text and e-mail about that, for their credit, but in French. Kind of arrogant to think every one speaks French. In any case, it took 4 interactions in the airport (including demanding a supervisor) to actually provide the details for the luggage claim. What followed was a lot of misinformation (wrong time and place for the luggage to arrive), a lot of frustrating with antiquate and not up to date at all website that provide ""status"" of the luggage, long waiting time to speak to a human (hour long) that in the end conclude they really don't know where the luggage is, culminating with 1am delivery as if it i completely normal.

All in all, that left a very sour taste in my mount.","2019-07-09"
"5","Hastle free flight into CDG (Paris)","This flight (8.5 hours) was very pleasant thanks to the great service of the Air France staff -- check-in, boarding, meals, in-flight entertainment, seats, etc.  Three of us were flying and we all had a pleasant flight.  The best part is that CDG is so much more transfer-traveler friendly.  It really is 30 minute for less from arrival gate to departure gate (for making international connections).  Many years ago (I have avoid CDG for a decade because I always missed connecting flights) it was a mini-nightmare to make a connecting flight, but now it is a breeze.  And the terminal are is very convenient for resting/napping/eating while awaiting your connecting flight.","2019-07-09"
"2","Awful customer service","We were forced to fly on a flybe propeller plane from Paris to manchester when we booked  business class... awful experience would never book with Air france they again didnt want to know when we complained","2019-07-09"
"3","Still very uncomfortable","We stop flying Air France a few years ago, because the seats are very hard, just the metal ! Even with cushions and blankets, three hours later you move and move. It leaves your buttocks with bruises. The food is bad, nothing tasty, desserts that say one thing, but you can’t find it. Very simple food, tasteless,even the bread. I do not know how they are not ashamed to give that rubbish.","2019-07-09"
"3","Premium economy not worth the extra","Seats did not recline...the seat moves forward and foot rest comes up causing your body to slump.  This was a non-sustainable position for more than 15 minutes.  I thought because I am short that it was just me, but others in the group who were 6 feet also complained.  Unless you need a wider seat this class is not worth the extra money.","2019-07-09"

I’m not a huge AirBus fan, but this was a newer model, clean and fresh on the inside.  Cabin staff was excellent.  Everyone there was bilingual, which helped.  Food, as you would expect was good.  And the best part of all when we got to the bag claim area, our bags were there.  I can’t say enough about the entire crew and experience","2019-07-02"

"5","Service at it's finest","Took 2 Air France flights, going from Toronto to Paris and then to Mumbai. Thoughout the journey the staff gives you their best service and helps you out at every step. Our flight to Mumbai was redirected as Mumbai Airport runways were closed off due to heavy rainfall, forcing us to go to Benguluru. Though we were stuck, Air France took care of all their passengers getting us accommodations, transport, and anything else we needed including a domestic flight to Mumbai. Would 100% use this airline again and will also tell others to do so as well","2019-07-02"
"4","Premium Economy - a real treat","I've always ended up on KLM for transatlantic flights over the last few years and was curious to see how Air France did their premium economy product. It's better than KLM and Delta with a specific seating area that is divided off once in flight. The food is good but not brilliant and trying to get extra soft drinks and snacks is impossible. That said, I'd choose them again as the seat space is more comfortable and you arrive slightly less dishvelled than on other airlines. Beware when connecting in CDG that if the flight is late you have a real obstacle course of immigration, security and a long walk between terminals.","2019-07-01"
"5","First time was ok","This was my first trip on Air France. With the exception of cramped legroom when I laid down, the Airbus was an excellent plane. The food, as one might expect, was very good as were the available wines. The in-flight entertainment had a wide variety and helped to pass the time. There was a glitch on the flight map which always showed we were still in Dallas. I was very surprised with the size of the lavatory! At 6-4, I could easily stand upright and there was room to actually turn around. This is wonderful if one needs to change clothing before landing. I may not have a chance to flight them again but will be looking for opportunities.","2019-07-01"
"1","Not the best","I will never fly with this airline again the most uncomfortable flight I've ever been on the food was inedible not that I expect good food on a flight half way through the flight I had a nose bleed which I have never had before and the attendant just looked at me and walked off never asked if I was ok","2019-07-01"

"2","Again a delay with Air France","CDG To GRU
Check in at the CDG was with long queues ... they are simply using the new self-boarding service. The Air France team is very arrogant and does not get busy with the passengers.
There were two Air France people guiding the queue and they were very classy people in the dress and rude when they spoke.
Trouble packing his luggage, none of them were willing to help.
After 1.5 hours of check in ... another long queue to board ...
Now do you think the flight will start ??? ... No problem in an engine was detected by the pilot .... returning to the gate .... 2 hours inside the plane waiting to reappear .... nothing ....
Pilot informed that we would need to change to another flight ... Mor 5 hours at the airport ... We faced a 45 minute queue to pick up a 15 EUROS food ticket ... insufficient value for lunch at the airport.
If possible I will never travel with Air France again !!!","2019-06-30"

I pre paid for luggage but then when I went to check in at the kiosk there was no sign of my payments - also no sign of my payments at the human check in point - so had to pay ridiculous luggage fees only to find the pre payments did in fact come out of my credit card.","2019-06-30"
"4","Efficient and comfortable, slow at CDG","The flight itself was smooth and efficient. The frustration was at a very crowded Charles de Gaulle. We had checked in on line but then still had to line up with everyone else just to do our bag check in. VERY undermanned, this took almost 45 unacceptable minutes (!!!), then the customs was also undermanned so very slow getting thru here (another 40 minutes!!) then a chaotic system for getting and putting items in trays for security/X-ray. Not a formal line, several advance together and jostle for position. Very slow and inefficient. The result was it was 2 hours for entering airport to getting to gate. Not good.","2019-06-30"
"1","Unhelpful and disorganized","Air France lost track of my luggage during a connecting flight from Paris to London. When my bag was found, I was told it would be delivered to me later that day. When it wasn't delivered, I was ""guaranteed"" it would arrive the next morning. It has now been 2 whole days and I still do not have my luggage, nor have I received any help in getting ahold of it. I have called the airline 4 times and have been told repeatedly that there is nothing they can do, and that I ""just can't"" speak to a supervisor. They ""can't"" contact the courier service that is supposed to deliver my bag to me, and they ""can't"" give me a number or address for said courier service. They also ""can't"" put me in contact with someone at the airport in Florence who speaks english that might be able to help me. I have cancelled various tours and events to make sure that I am close to my Airbnb when I get a call about my delivered bag -- all a complete waste. I am in the dark on when I'll have access to my own toiletries, clothes, and technologies and Air France refuses to help me. If you want to guarantee your checked luggage will arrive at your destination, DO NOT fly Air France.","2019-06-30"
"2","Abysmal customer service","This is the second trip in a row that I have needed assistance. Both times all I could get by calling or online  was to ask for assistance at the airport.  The waiting time to see a rep at the airport was overwhelming. It is clear that once they have your money, they simply don’t care. The flights and cabin attendants have been fine but if anything goes wrong, the chance for timely and helpful assistance is apparently nil.
On the previous flight (business class) the response to my email question came a day after I was already home.","2019-06-30"
"5","Vacation return","Flew return from Paris to Detroit on my way to Tampa.  AF378
Single seat 3A, nice lounge at CDG, good check-in and customer service, food very good, plane modern and clean.  I would recommend, over using Delta","2019-06-29"
"4","Good","Paris CDG is my fauvorite airport for conections, isn’t crowded as for example airport at Istnabul. AF is a very good airlines, I never had any problem with changeing of flight. The food is good and very good champagne. However on this flight there wasn’t any onboard entertainment ","2019-06-29"
"5","Air France","Air France is a great airline to fly. It was a short flight but we received a drink and the most delicious apricot beignets. I highly recommend!","2019-06-29"
"1","Worst Airline we have flown with","Our holiday was booked with Virgin Holidays but they farmed us out the Air France. Heathrow to Paris with plane change to carry on to Mauritius. The safety on this airline was disgusting. It was done on screen and the crew walked up and down aisles but never told people to fasten seat belts, put seat and trays upright or turn off electronic devices. People separated from members of their party were allowed to move together to no note of these moves were noted and there was a lot of change of seating. Arriving in Paris we did not expect to have to go through all the security and passport control again and staff here were very slow, rude and very unhelpful when we were trying to find out were we needed to go. Food on the plane was not very good at all.","2019-06-17"
"5","Great flights and service.","Used Air France economy from SFO to CDG and business class on the way back. Overall, we were very impressed with the entire trip. Check in was quick and easy. Boarding was quick and organized. While the leg space was decent, the economy seats were hard and uncomfortable for a 10 hour flight. My back was actually hurting by the time we got to Paris. But in my experience, the seats were not any worse than most airlines. Service was amazing. Very professional, friendly and attentive. Food was also good. I actually enjoyed the meal and found it very tasty. Return in business class was a great treat. While it was my first time flying business class and have nothing to compare it to, it was an amazing experience. The meals and service were outstanding. The seat were super comfortable with tons of leg room and fully recline into a bed. It made the 10 hour flight back go so quickly. I would recommend their business class any day.","2019-06-17"
"5","Kinda like flying 1st Class","We had a Great flight and great crew traveling both directions.  Air France is Setting a high standard for flying.  We also loved the safety video.  Well done!","2019-06-17"
"1","Bad.. unable to help after missing a flight connection... AVOIR DE GAULLE AIRPORT !","After missing our flight connection, due to bad service at the gate for the airplane to unload, we missed our flight connection. Air France gave up helping after 30 min and said "" Make your plans""....  I ended up have to use buses to reach my destination (Copenhagen, from Paris), missing a day of my trip, losing my luggage...

Air France and Charles De Gaulle airport are unreliable !","2019-06-17"
"1","My parents would have died because of these people.","1. My mother requested wheel chair assistance though i already booked wheel chair for both my father & mother, as she is old and has deformities in her leg. 
2. She was taken in baggage car instead of wheel chair or electric transportation car 
3. Whole family was not allowed to be with her. 
4. She was left in a place and with people whom do not know french or english. 
5. She got scared and didn't reach to next gate for final destination for more than an hour.
6. BOTH MY FATHER & MOTHER WOULD HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF THIS. 
7. She is old lady. Luckily another lady helped her. 

Its really aweful. 

PLEASE NEVER SELECT CDG AIRPORT AS TRANSIT FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE.","2019-06-17"
"4","Pleasant experience","The flight departed on time & the overall experience was pleasant. The inflight meal was great & the staff was pretty helpful. There were multiple snacks available on board at varied times and the entertainment system also presented content for diverse passengers. 

All in all the experience was great & travelling in economy class was comfortable.","2019-06-16"
"3","Reasonable","Decent food and service from friendly,polite staff. The airline itself seemed dated and I couldn't even recline my seat. I didn't bother with the in flight entertainment media as I just wanted to sleep.","2019-06-16"
"5","Air France Atl-Paris","The flight departed on time. The crew was very friendly and helpful. The video of the pre-flight instructions is very well done and gets your attention.
Food was tasty and hot. The plane had plenty of legroom and the temperature in the plane was comfortable. The choice of movies was so-so.","2019-06-16"
"4","Improved","It was a pleasant flight. Food was okay and staff was much better than last time. Flight left and arrived on time.","2019-06-16"
"1","Monitor Inoperative, Reneged on Compensation, Late Flight, Late Luggage","An inoperative monitor is usually not a tragedy but for a nearly 8 hour flight, it was still quite aggravating (besides failing requirement to provide mandatory safety briefing). In addition, the flight was late (no explanation given), cabin air temperature was very cold, and water drops came down on me from the air vent.  When reset did not fix my monitor, the purser offered a credit for tax-free purchase as compensation but then he did not follow up. When I asked again later he said it was too late. Worst, the late departure and then late arrival caused our luggage to miss the connection causing other  problems. I don't fly Air France often, but on previous flight they were also late with equipment problems.  Planes are not well maintained and poor customer service.","2019-06-16"
"3","Trip to Europe","We purchased our tickets on January 1, 2019, for our trip on May 8, 2019, on May 7, 2019, at night we received a text from Air France telling us that the seats that we reserved were not available and that we were bumped to regular economy.  We called Delta as our tickets were purchased thru Delta and Delta said that everything was fine and provided us with new seat numbers in the original class that was booked.  On May 8, 2019, morning we received a text from Air France telling that our 8:00 pm flight was canceled, again we called Delta which told us that they could not understand what was going on as their computer was showing that our flight was scheduled departing on time, after being put on hold, the Delta representative told us that after checking with Air France that our flight was canceled and they were booking us on the 4:30 pm Air France flight that day.  At that time it was already near noon so we rushed to the airport to try to figure out what seats we would have, we had to go to the counter at the gate to find out that we were seated together in Economy at the end of the plane.  The good part: We left on the same day as we had car and hotel reservations the next day, the service onboard Air France was very good, the Delta representatives were very helpful and tried to do the best they could.  The bad part:  So much confusion and misinformation from Air France which makes us feel that to be Elite flyer with Delta does mean much for Air France.  So next time I will make sure is a Delta flight not Air France.","2019-06-16"
"5","Best flying experience in years","We flew economy from JFK to Paris and Business Class back.  Service was excellent.  Food and amenities were very good.  Plenty of seating room.  They also helped us work though some booking issues where I thought they went above and beyond.  I would not hesitate to fly Air France again.","2019-06-16"
"4","Excellent service, but never miss a leg in your booked itinerary","Air France is a very professional and provides excellent and courteous service. But please keep in your mind that you should never miss a flight in your itinerary and expect the other flights to be used as normal. 
I missed my Copenhagen to Paris flight owing to a family exigency and went to the CDG airport in Paris while returning for the booked return flight. And was told to contact the attendant. After moving a few counters, met some very professional, helpful and courteous staff, who advised that I should contact the ticketing centre ASAP. Later, got a Boarding Pass after paying 250 Euros with a standby status for the seat. Later the staff provided me with a seat towards the end of the boarding as the flight was fully booked. But it was a lesson for me to never miss a leg of booked flights itinerary. And hence am sharing the same with you all travellers, just in case if you were not aware of.","2019-06-15"
"3","Most uncomfortable seats of any airline.","Flew Air France from Athens to Paris then Paris to Detroit. On Athens to Paris run, our seats would not recline. No audio or video to watch ( a 3 1/2 hour flight). From Paris to Detroit, upgraded to Air France Preferred seats - I could not find any Premium Economy seats on their website - these were the only options available. When we got on the plane we find that they are nothing but coach seats, just closer to the front of the plane. Big deal. No legroom and narrow seat width. These seats were rock hard. - no padding. Both my wife and I were squirming through the whole flight. My butt was so sore as was my back. We both had to get up twice to go stand at the back of the plane as did many others. Their transatlantic flights are pathetic - cramming you into these narrow uncomfortable seats for 8 hours is hard to take. Fly another airline until they fix this problem. ","2019-06-15"
"3","Average Service","We booked Delta but it was operated by Air France.  The overall service was just average nothing special.  Food was Ok!","2019-06-15"
"3","Returning Home from a Holiday","Boarded AF 0194 from Paris to Bangalore on 4th June2019.Flight took off on time.Enroute we were informed that the plane would have to go back and go to Athens since one of the passengers required urgent medical attention.Although this detour would delay the flight by 3 hours nobody got upset since it was for a good cause.I fly Air France regularly and have always complained about the food and inflight entertainment.Hope the take necessary corrective action","2019-06-15"
"5","Great flight on time and comfortable","we were very pleased with this  flight . Although Budapest is a small airport everything was handled very will, There were no permanent gate for Air France but shared sign in kiosks worked perfectly","2019-06-15"
"1","Lost baggage","They lost and never found out baggage. They ruined our trip and have been no help. It was a direct flight. Do not fly Air France. They keep replying they are there for you, yet they keep telling me to track my lost bag. They are not easy to contact or work with. Pick another airline","2019-06-15"
"1","Worse experience","Everything was going fine until we landed to Paris. From there our nightmare started. The original flight from Montreal to Paris had about 35 minutes late so we couldn't make it to our next flight to Mulhouse planned for 9h15am. At this point we were offered to take the next flight at 12pm by following a very complicated procedure (find a way to transfer our luggage and get to Orly airport). After talking to 3 different employees, nobody could confirm what was happening with the luggage transfer and everyone had a different version. Also we found out that it takes about 1 hour to get to Orly so we couldn't catch that flight. Long story short we took the next flight to Mulhouse at 9h55pm and waisted the whole day at the airport (13 hours). What I retain from this first experience with Air France is a serious lack of communication and organization and not proactive at all to find a solution that make sense to us. Very disappointed and exhausted.","2019-06-15"
"3","Started well and finished badly","The service and the food were good. The seats were comfortable and there was enough leg room. However, the connecting Lisbon to Paris was almost 3 hours late without any explanation from the airline. Moreover, I got one of my bags 2 days after I arrived. I've been flying for 25 years (mostly with Air Canada and Swiss) and that has never happened. Needless to say, it's a big hassle.","2019-06-15"
"1","Rude and lazy staff","I was flying from Amsterdam to Beirut thru CDG and had the worst seating all thanks to the terrible Air France staff. First i tried to check in Amsterdam airport, the automated check in booth told me there was an error with seating after i paid for a upgrade to an exit seat (i am 193cm  tall and would not fit on window or middle seats). The assistants threw me to the gate officers. The rude gate officers gave me the exit seat but claimed they couldn't see the seating in the connecting flight and that i should try with tye gate officers of the connecting flight. I go to the connecting flight officers they tell me they can't adjust my seat ( a lie because they can) and that i should have done that while checking in. I told the lazy officer what happened to me but he couldn't care if his unprofessional company was to blame....","2019-06-03"
"5","Good service, good food, good wine","A long flight (13 hrs), but helped by good service, good food, good wine. They also have a wide range of other beverages - try the cognac!","2019-06-02"
"3","Uncomfortable seat arrangement","I would suggest never to select seat 29B / 29C on the Boeing 777 from Singapore to Paris (AF257). These seats are awkwardly not directly behind the seat in front. And that means, tray table and entertainment screen not directly in front of you. Imagine having your tray table encroaching into someone else's space? Or.. hmm. Watching some soap drama with a stranger beside you. Not good at all. Have written in to ask Air France why the awkward seat configuration. Still waiting to hear back.","2019-06-02"
"4","Long haul is good but short haul is bad","Flew to Heathrow via CDG. The long haul portion was good enough leg room and good food. Flew on A380 in the upper back. However - I transferred to a A320 and the seats are so tight I couldn't move my legs at all. ","2019-06-02"
"3","A quick flight but not well organised","This was a quick flight between Paris and Florence Italy.  We were advised that the flight was fully booked and hand luggage should be kept to a minimum and we are asked the check-in some hand luggage to help.  I did so but notice that many passengers came on board with 2 or even 3 bags as hand luggage.  Some bags were almost too big for the overhead lockers.  Air France needs to review its policy about on board luggage.  This made the trip a little uncomfortable for me and those who did check-in their bags","2019-06-02"
"4","Time to replace Business Class Seats. Really!","Just returned to Mexico City on an Air France flight from Paris. Business Class. I like this airline for many reasons, but the Business class seats are massively worn out. They look fine, but the padding inside the upholstery is totally used up. I understand that they are in the process of updating. I have made a decision not to use Air France until I am sure that the Business Class in the condition that justifies the cost.","2019-06-02"
"5","Great flight","One hour flight to Stuttgart with Air France Hop on Embraer 170 from terminal 2G.

During the flight : one drink and one croissant.
Friendly crew also,  will fly again with Air France

"5","It’s time to fly back","On May the 14th I had(literally) to fly back to Mexico City. Air France is undoubtedly my favorite Airline. This time I flew back alone. My wife had to take a much earlier flight ( three and a half weeks due to a family emergency) and Air France helped us in that matter also. My flight AF0178 took off From CDG on time as always, landed in MEX a little bit ahead of time. The Flight was excellent as were the personnel, attentive service and food and drinks.
What amazed me the most this time is the way Paris Aeroports have gone out of their way to make things easier for everyone. It’s very easy to park at the Depose minutes section so you can be dropped off or picked up in no time. Security IS very tight AND strict; but officers are very attentive and helpful IF you have nothing to hide.
Another excellent feature is the way you can check in, weigh, label and deposit your bags yourself with outmost ease with only one single person to help in case you should need. Security clearance done, you proceed to boarding gate via a small train an once there, in spite of the big crowds, You can be in your seat in a very decent amount of time. 
Merci mille fois Air France!!!
Au Revoir et À Bientôt!!!","2019-06-01"
"1","Nightmarish lost and found process","Part of an airline's customer service duty is to operate a lost and found.  Air France has avoided that duty, and externalized the cost and time involved, by 
contracting out its lost and found service to a business called France Objets Trouves.     Even though Air France employees find the items, you cannot claim them through Air France, and you cannot contact Air France about your items.  You cannot call or email this business, you can only make a claim on the website, and then they email you, but as a ""do not reply"" email.  They do not have a public phone number. 
The website doesn't work reliably on mobile devices (which is what travelers would  often be using) getting people into nonsensical loops, such as saying the claim has  posted, and then another screen saying it has not.  It requires you choose a subcategory of the lost item, but the only subcategories of ""travel documents"" are ""post card"" and ""maps.""  No category for passport, which is what I lost.  The site states there is a fee for the service, but there is no screen or  link to pay the fee.  
The inability to reach the company and to confirm that I could get my lost item put a damper on my trip.  My tour leader and I each spent hours trying to deal with this, and trying other ways to reach Air France, but it was impossible.
Finally I got back to the airport and tried to go to the address where the email said I could retrieve my item, and neither the taxi drivers in line, nor the dispatcher, knew where this address was.   If my tour leader hadn't gone with me and insisted, in French, that he knew where it was, I don't think they would have taken me there, and I would be stranded, a few kilometers from my passport, but with no way to get there. 
The place itself, when I got there, was Kafkaesque--you go in this secure building which is a lot like a prison entrance, the guards don't know anything about the procedure, and you just wait till someone comes. 
It was a very stressful and expensive experience, and none of it was necessary.  
Air France should sever its ties with this company, and go back to providing accessible lost and found services to its passengers.","2019-06-01"

When you have a connection flight. If you are interested to go through that torture

"1","Worst flight timing","cancelled 3 days before departure. 

Air france gives a worst option that takes 32 hours to reach bangalore from stuttgart, which usually would need 9 hrs.

Good Airlines if someone wishes to do world trip in single tickets, though you  end up in 4-5 airports in your journey.","2019-05-31"
"4","Amazing flight, but make sure your carry-on is SMALLER than requirements","As always, the Air France flight experience was flawless. Friendly staff, good meals, wine with dinner, great entertainment options. We love Air France and fly it whenever possible. Our only hiccup (and this is the first time we had this issue) was with our carry on bags. We bought them several years ago specifically because they fit Air France's requirements. We've flown with them dozens of times, and there has never been a problem. We're always careful about weight, and of course the size is fine. However on this flight we were pulled aside, and when the baggage-size attendant put my bag in the measuring guide, he put it in at a slant so of course it didn't settle in evenly. He told me it was too big. I readjusted the bag and slid it in, but he still said it was no good. We could have argued it but didn't want to be ""those"" Americans, so we paid our 50 euros and checked the bag. It was truly annoying, especially since this has never been a problem before. It's left a bad taste in my mouth and now I'm concerned about my next flight on Air France.","2019-05-31"
"4","Consistently Good","Overall I've been pleased with flying Air France.  I've flown Air France for several other connections before, as well.  They're level of service is consistently high.  I always appreciate the professionalism of their staff and the cleanliness of the aircraft.  

The red eye flight from CDG to JNB was aboard a Boeing 777, recently updated with the new Premium Economy.  When I walked passed the new Premium Economy section, my envious eyes were astonished - it looked like only a slight downgrade to Business Class.  

Back in cattle class, the experience wasn't bad, however.  The food is still pretty good for airplane food.

My only complaint: Selection of recent movies on the in-flight entertainment was a little sparse.  The system itself is great (touch screen, etc).","2019-05-30"
"3","Seats could be more convenient","Average flight overall. Good work of cabin crew - help and  courtesy towards passegers.  Tight and narrow seats with very limited room for legs.","2019-05-30"
"2","We knew what we were going to get","We've used Air France once before and weren't impressed then.  But this route had limited options so we had little choice.  The check in line at Heathrow was very long and they seemed to open late.  The plane and the toilets were very clean all the way, both ways.  However, the cabin is from the dark ages.   4 inch screens, pull out control, no USB, difficult to view films and fast forward or reverse etc.   The food out to Madagascar was OK, the food on our return was pretty poor.   As we've experienced before, the only drink service you will get is prior to a meal service.   Other than that, it's up to you to get your own from the back of the cabin.  On board service is pretty poor and not what you'd expect from a national carrier.  And Paris CdG is dreadful.  They cancelled our connection back to London (we did have more than 2 weeks notice) and put us on a later flight.  So after an 11 hour overnight flight, we had a 5 hour wait in Paris CdG.  The only food outlets they have are a sushi bar, a caviar bar, a bakery, a starbucks and a pret.   There is no where to get a proper meal.    And Air France have refused to give compensation or vouchers for any food even though they told us when the flight was changed, and at the transfer desk on arrival in Paris CdG, that we should claim on our return.   Air France, you've got a long way to go to match other national carriers.","2019-05-30"
"3","EDI good security assistance","The EDI airport impressed before and after security check with the desk areas for assembling one’s cases/items for the security line. Nice. Didn’t have to pull one’s self together with nothing to put stuff on. Airport does seem to follow the Heathrow idea of not announcing the gate until less than an hour before the flight.","2019-05-29"
"1","Downgrade from Business to Premium","Oh My God !!!! Crew ask for 6 seats in business class cause their resting area was full of bed bugs !
Guess what, business class flyer have been downgrade and this is it !
Customer experience under 0
Never ever again on this Airline even if they have re imburse me the cost of the flight !
total shame on them !","2019-05-18"
"2","Not so chic (dried vomit on seat)","If your airline is constantly telling me that it is “chic,” it must not be very chic. Such is the case with Air France, which we flew between NYC and Paris on their 777 and A380. 

Starting with the positives: food was above average, the legroom was better than British Airways, and crew is friendly enough. If traveling as a couple, try to grab the double seats at the rear of the cabin on their 777 - they felt much roomier and private than other long haul economy seats we’ve tried. 

Negatives - my girlfriend had to sit on the provided blanket because THERE WAS DRIED VOMIT ALL OVER HER SEAT, and there was also a streak of it on the screen in front as well. This was completely unacceptable and disgusting and, to be fair, we should have brought it up to the cabin crew at the time. Also, if flying on the A380, note that the overhead storage bins towards the rear of the upper deck are VERY tiny above the window seats - though this is not the airline’s fault. The extremely outdated cabin and uncomfortable seats on their A380, however, are entirely Air France’s fault. The 777 product was much nicer and newer apart from our dirty seat. 

TL;DR - we likely will never fly Air France again, because kicking off a vacation by sitting in a vomit-covered seat isn’t our idea of chic.","2019-05-17"
"3","The high point - we landed safely.","The seats were very small, and on a seven hour flight this can make a big difference between a happy passenger and cranky one at the end of the flight.  I guess the sardines in a can approach chasing profits continues to win the day for Air France.  Most unfortunate. The service at the gate in Paris was excellent.  My wife was using a cane, and the Air France ground staff were very solicitous.  Once in the air I cannot say the same for the flight crew.  Our primary steward seemed indifferent at best, and it appeared to be a bother for him to have to be working.  The food was edible.  The selection of movies was okay.  I define a successful flight is one you can walk away from - by that standard this flight was then an uninspiring success.","2019-05-17"
"3","Service below expectation","On this March I travelled from Mumbai to Basel via Amsterdam through Air France.Poor inflight entertainment .Also quality and quantity of food is below international standards. So next time I will prefer to travel through another flight like Singapore airlines, Ethiad or Emirates in which I enjoyed my flight in past.","2019-05-17"
"3","On time but otherwise unexceptional","The flight from Birmingham was to Charles de Gaulle with a cross city transfer to Orly for the flight to Guadeloupe. There was no mention in any of the pre-flight information that the free transfer tickets had to be obtained from the Air France Customer service desk before boarding the shuttle transfer so rather than wait another 40 minutes we paid an additional Euro 40. Poor film selection on the outbound and not much better on the return. We had booked an upgrade meal, which was served very promptly on the way out but on the return we had to ask for a drink to go with the meal and weren't offered a second. Some of the Air France cabin staff were friendly enough but, as we have experienced previously, if you're not French, most of them can be very off-hand.","2019-05-17"
"3","Disappointed in leg room","I was under the impression that international flights were just a bit better with the leg room than domestic American flights, but I was wrong.  Air France is just as greedy with their leg room as American Domestic flights.  Everything else was ok.","2019-05-17"
"3","Old plane, not enough food for a long flight","My review is based on two long haul flights, Paris - Lima and Santiago de Chile - Paris. On the positive side, the crew was polite and attentive and the seats were fairly comfortable for the economy class. The second flight had a newer cabin with a modern entertainment system. This wasn't unfortunately true about the first flight. The seats and screens were old. One wasn't able to watch a movie from the start, but from wherever it was running in the system, so I saw the second half of a film before the first one. It was an old and run-down plane, as I said.
Whilst food was good, it wasn't enough for such a long flight. Both times there was a warm meal at the beginning and a smaller one before the end of the flight, but in between nothing was served. One had to go to the back of the plane to get drinks and snacks, but it wasn't always enough for all passengers + the snacks were not sufficient for a person for 10-12 hours. Another aspect of this arrangement was that everyone had to go to the back of the plane. So if your seat was there, it got quite loud and unpleasant after a while. 
All in all, it was a rather disappointing experience. In future I'll choose KLM for long haul flights to Latin America, which I found to be better (including connecting in Amsterdam rather than the unpleasant bus experience between terminals in Paris).","2019-05-17"

"4","Good Service,Extremely Bad logistics and Schedule","Dear Fellow Traveller,
Would like to share my experience of my recent flight out of Paris to Geneva on AF.
On the plus side,AF has considerably improved under the new Canadian management.Flight attendants and check in agents have gone out of their way to check in bags at the very last minute and guide you to the layout of this terminal for you to be able to catch the flight within very tight timing.The service on board was excellent, nothing  to complain about.
The problem lies in codeshared flights which may or may not have a legitimate connection.Absolutely  not flexible call centre politics, once they sell you a flight,forget about good will, flexibility or compromise.
Definitely,the AF Paris to Geneva remains a very good option,provided the Air France becomes serious about customer service and extends the schedule beyond the very last flight at 20.45 pm.
Although AF is very often fashionably late,you as a fellow passenger stand a better chance of making this connection.
Recommended,
provided the management extends the flights to cover later flights,like the 21.30 pm departure.
Good luck and safe travels!

"3","Disappointed in the leg room","This was my 1st time traveling internationally and going that far of a distance.
I am 5'10"" and my husband is 6'3"" we were both disappointed in the leg room, we expect less leg room for local flights, but were sadly disappointed on this international flight. Even the seats were not very comfortable for this long flight.  Not to mention if the person in front of you decides to recline because it is a long flight, there is not much difference.  I also understand that people pay for the luxury of business and first class at a premium, but seriously for an 11 hour flight there should be a little more leg room, and more room so when you do recline and the person behind you needs to get up you are not disturbing their peace.  And there should definitely be cushioned seats!","2019-05-16"
"2","very disappointed","Air France like British Airways have more than the shadow of itself is a company that is weary is falling free quality is not at the rendezvous I was a member Flying  Blue Platinum by doing many steals their business class but the quality 15 years ago is no longer there.","2019-05-16"
"3","A380 excitement dulled","We were super excited to ride the upper level and this enormous aircraft yet we're quickly disappointed upon sitting at our seats.
The seating was old, frayed and genuinely coming apart. Flaps were hanging, exposing the seat mechanics. 
While the small foot rests were a nice touch, the seats, again, were so old that one of the two couldn't even drop to be used.
The entertainment wasn't that bad as far as selection. But yet again, it was the old double point connection. Even though they provided in ear headphones, not having the option to use my personal over ear headphones was disappointing for a 10 hour flight. 
We ordered ala cart meals and we're again disappointed in content, portions and taste. They were served in what was a nice ""box"" yet upon opening it wasn't anything near what we expected. There was about 2 pieces of meat, or 3 if you count the smaller piece, in the beef dish, the ""salad"" was not what was on the menu I ordered or even on the printed menu. My partner did not enjoy her meal which she described as ""old"". The rolls we're genuinely ice cold. We would have settled for room temp at least. The plum dessert was more of what a beginning culinary student would make their very first time in a kitchen. Two large prunes and a single overcooked pastry looming above and again ice cold. We would have done better getting the in flight options and saved $50.
I would do more research into the aircraft IF I was to fly Air France again.
I find Southwest is more comfortable overall than this cabin as a comparison.","2019-05-16"

Can't recall the quality of meal, so it should be average. No paper hand towel, paper cup and hand cream provided in toilet, not up to standard for long haul.","2019-05-15"
"4","Good Flight But Need More Restrooms","We flew an Air France A380 (full double-decker) to and from Paris in Premium Economy section. There is definitely more legroom in these seats and they recline a bit more than regular economy. The amenities were nice although the food was not that much better. The entertainment system is nice with plenty of options. 
The only problem we had was the distance to the restrooms. We were in the second row from the front of the section and the restrooms we had to use were al the way in the bqck of the next section. It was like running the gauntlet trying to dodge perople with heads and legs leaniing out into, or totally blocking, the aisleway.","2019-05-15"
"5","Air France flight attendant helped unaccompanied minor when Delta messed up several times","I called Delta's Unaccompanied Minor Program four times over four months and each time they had somehow lost all of my daughter's pick-up and drop-off information. At the airport last night, no one had even been alerted that she was an unaccompanied minor and there was AGAIN no drop-off or pick-up info. Her flight was through partner AirFrance. AirFrance was alarmed and disgusted that they had no information because they did not have anyone to accompany her off the plane in Paris. My daughter reported to me that the Air France flight attendants were very nice to her and were really mad about Delta. The head flight attendant accompanied my daughter off the plane, through passport control, through baggage claim and customs, all the way to my father-in-law's arms. I don't believe that was her job. She seriously saved the day. Delta should give her the $150 directly and pay damages for the time, worry and fear they put me and my daughter through - Delta's Unaccompanied Minor Program is totally incompetent. The flight attendants on Air France are EXTRAORDINAIRE!!!! Thank you to them.","2019-05-15"

"4","Pleasant flight despite inferior biz product ","Everyone seems to hate on Air France’s A380 business class hard product.  While it trails in comparison to leading biz layouts, it is still a pleasant flight given the convenience and frequency of departing times to and from JFK. 

Although not fully lie flat, the seat itself is comfortable enough for a day flight.  Yes the cabin can get crowded and yes window seat flyers might present challenges to aisle accessibility, but at least the meal service is rather tasty considering other airlines serving inedible food.  

If you’re flexible on departure times and require a more private cabin, then take their one flight that’s on the 777 which has reverse herringbone and a less hectic environment.

The crew was impecably dressed and with a smile at all times; allways ready to help and super professional. Even the food was better than Iberia and I had legroom in my seat plus ....it reclined !!! Felt like I was flying in the Eighties when service was an important part of the fly. Thank you for making a long trip a great experience.","2019-04-29"
"1","Worst airline ever, worst customer service ever","I booked a 30,000 HKD (over 3,000 EUR) flight in premium economy from Hong Kong to Paris with Air France. I usually fly with Cathay Pacific because their service is so much better than Air France but this time, their premium economy was fully booked and I had to go straight to work after a 13-hour flight so I figured I'd try AF once again (previous experience, my flight was cancelled and staff was rude). At check in, they told me that my agent booked a seat in premium despite the class being fully booked. This was a lie. I called my agent who confirmed I paid extra actually to have a seat confirmed in premium economy. AF overbooked their premium economy, downgraded me, lied to me first and then did nothing but offered a 150 EUR voucher that I can only use on AF flights (which couldn't be more useless since I never intend to fly this horrible airline again). And the funny thing is that they said I could use the 150 EUR voucher to get an upgrade in the future. 
I asked if my return flight could be in business since they downgraded me to economy with no prior warning (I would've flown Cathay's economy if I had known) and their response was simply no. 
Worst customer service ever, worst airline ever. No wonder your airline is not doing well when you treat your customers like this.","2019-04-29"

"3","An improvment","This flight had adequate leg room. This long flight had multiple food services and although we requested kosher food, the airline did not provide it. They have decided not to provide this for flights from Paris to Lima. We had to bring food with us.","2019-04-29"
"2","very uncomfortable flight","This relatively short flight was one of the most uncomfortable flights we had ever traveled. the seats were so close to each other that our knees almost touched our chest.","2019-04-29"
"3","Not very impressed with their Business Class flight","I have flown on several airlines on business class before, and I have to say that the AF flight was very average compared to other airlines. I'm breaking down the criteria:
Legroom - Not spacious enough, and I'm not even tall (I'm just 5'4"")
Seat comfort - Not very comfortable, not wide enough. I could not even lie on my back in comfort, thus could not sleep very well in-flight.
In-flight Entertainment - Adequate
Customer service - Adequate. There were about 3 meal choices, and the attendants asked each biz class passenger their preferences, including us. However, when it was time to serve the meal, we were told that sorry, our choice had already run out. My question was - WHY? Why would you ask someone for their meal choice when clearly, there was no choice at the end? Why could they not have informed us that what we wanted was not longer available AT THE TIME THEY ASKED FOR OUR CHOICE? I found this quite annoying and frustrating. I get that this may happen in economy, but we were in Business Class!! They couldn't count how many meat dishes were still available?? For me, this is a fail in customer service. Otherwise, there was nothing overly exciting about the meal choices, nor the snacks (chocolates, Thai cup noodles, wine and soda)
Value for money - Average
Cleanliness - Okay
Check-in and boarding - Not sure if this is partly the fault of the airline, but during boarding, soon after we presented our boarding pass to the ground attendant, we were stopped by one who I presume was an airport security officer. We were stopped and questioned like we were Southeast Asian undocumented aliens trying to leave their beloved country in stealth mode. It was only until I presented my UN Laissez Passe passport that this officer gradually lowered his guard a little. Still, in a probable last attempt to justify his unwarranted questioning (my sister and I were held and questioned at the business class boarding gate, in front of the other passengers for more than 5 minutes!!!), he posed his last question to us: Did you bring in more than USD10,000 in cash into France? DUH?! Did we look THAT dumb, just because we were Filipinos? I'm sure he would have loved to hear us say yes so that he could detain us further and not allow us to take our flight back to Bangkok. And all the while, the AF ground attendants were doing nothing, just listening in on our convo, when they knew that we were there on business, my sister had a valid French tourist visa, we only stayed about 9 days in all, and we were traveling biz class both ways!!! Are those the profile of undocumented SE Asian aliens?? Pathetic!!
Food and Beverage - Refer to Customer Service","2019-04-28"

"3","Something left to be desired","Air France has definitely stepped up service on there flights, however for a business class seat it was somewhat disappointing,  the seats are lie  flat but small and they do not have a seat cushions like air New Zealand to cover your seat when you sleep, so one has to lie down on a nasty seat, the flight es quiet and that was a definite plus.","2019-04-28"

No advice to passengers disembarked in Casablanca that they need to fill out an arrival card. These not handed out ahead of time like most other airlines; not even information about where to locate them in the airport!
A number of elderly passengers confused & frustrated.
Ranked experience a 4 only because of valiant effort by the cabin crew to make the best of a bad situation. I think they were embarrassed themselves but were very professional & respectful regardless.
Give Air France 🇫🇷 a miss !

I was travelling with a 5 and 7 year olds. Depite the request that I needed to be near them, it was ignored, I managed to get a seat next to my 5 year old grand son thanks to a lady who could see his distress. No effort to get closer to the the other boy and no effort to speak to him or reassure him. Lucky the flight was only 1 hour! and to top it all our connecting flight to London was cancelled.","2019-04-28"

"5","Relaxed ‘Hop’ to Paris","The Air France service from Aberdeen to Charles de Gaulle, Paris is a great way for someone living in northeast Scotland to go to one of the greatest cities in Europe. The AirFrance service is first class, even for someone flying economy. The cabin staff are polite to a fault, and although the snack was limited it was tasty (and so was the wine which was available to accompany it). The only downside is that this service does not merit a terminal gate, which means that the aircraft parks on the periphery of CDG, meaning that you are bussed to the terminal. It is inconvenient and just delays the start of the holiday.","2019-04-28"

Our return flight was a rather a different story...We arrived at the airport, checked in OK with suitcase only to find we had no seats, we were over-booked! This meant we could not get back home until the next day!

To be totally honest, the Air France staff were pure Bostin!. They helped us book a flight the next day, seat numbers, hotel sorted with meals, compensation sorted, coach to and from the hotel (Ibis Style!), and check-in next day.

It also turns out the young lady who helped us had finished her shift, but stayed with us until we were all sorted, she was so helpful and understanding with us!

Well done Air France, you have an exceptional member of staff here!","2019-04-28"
"3","This is a Business Class Lounge???","While the flight from Paris to Los Angeles was very good, Air France should be ashamed of what they calling the Business Class Lounge at Charles De Gaulle airport. They were selling admission to an already overcrowded, hot & dirty space. We found waiting at the gate more comfortable than the lounge!","2019-04-27"
"4","Great Start for a Vacation","Air France offers excellent 1st class service. The service, food & entertainment as well as comfort were spot on. 
Unfortunately, there were a couple of flies in the ointment. 1st the power for electronic gear did not work at all in the cabin & apparently no one on board could fix it. 
2nd Air France offers pick up service from airport to hotel upon arrival in their advertising. We could find no one to assist us in using this service. When we called Air France we of course got a Delta rep who told us that service was only available to Premiere passengers not first class. Dull I think a little more training is in order. Amex at least was able to get a telephone number in France. Unfortunately no matter what time we called, the number was never answered & you could not leave a message. 
Regardless it was a good flight","2019-04-27"

There is NO consideration for people making a tight connection that the airline has booked you on. The airport and airline staff are indifferent and not organized to make connections a success.

"1","Air France is the worst","Our nonstop flight out Miami was cancelled with no explanation from AirFrance and unable to reach them by phone because we were driving 2 hours to Miami. Their app was not at all helpful and finally we were able to rebook our outbound flight with a be ry helpfully Delta agent, but had to connect through Atlanta which we could have done six months ago from our home airport in Ft Myers, but we chose a nonstop on Air France. We were told by Air France that they didn’t recognize Delta preferred seat status but would give us a discount if we purchased an up front seat which we did on our outbound flight..... that was cancelled!! Delta was very accommodating on our rebook, but we still had to connect thru ATL. Our Delta flights were perfect, but we arrived in Paris 4 hours later than or original time. Air France never communicated with us at all and we found oot that the original flight was rescheduled with a different flight number and left Miami 4-5 hours later than scheduled. Our return nonstop on Air France was uneventful except for being told many times by gate agents and AirFrance lounge employees that they “don’t recognize” Delta status or American Express access. Repeating “we have no relationship with American Express”. The level of service on the flight was terrible with no flight attendant doing any service except the two “meal” services. We were told we could come to the back the plane for drinks or snacks which we did not do so don’t know how that would work. All in all the flight attendants were rude and unhelpful. In our bulkhead row, 5 of the 8 pull up video players or trays were broken and obviously had been for a while because of evidence of previous tape marks on the posts. Unacceptable. We are 70 year old lifetime world travelers and have never had a worse experience with airline in terms of service that would be normally expected. Will never fly Air France again.","2019-04-14"
"4","Very good service","Seat room was good.Seats could do with more upholstery (like many others).Service was excellent, charming, obliging and accommodating.This came as a surprise as previous experience was not so good.This flight was a substitution for a cancelled Delta/virgin flight,and this experience encourages us to use Air France again.","2019-04-13"

Seats had broken pieces that were taped up with masking tape and they had stains all over them. The headrest sides wouldn’t stay in place. There were old orange peels in the back pocket of the seat in front of me. The tray back was also covered in dried up food. It was hot and it felt like there wasn’t any air moving. Not a very pleasant 8-1/2 hour flight. I wouldn’t recommend at all.","2019-04-13"
"1","The connection flight from hell.. don’t fly with this company EVER","My one hour flight to Paris to get my connection to Australia caused me 3 days of delay. 
The original flight from Düsseldorf was delayed by 4 hours which caused me to miss my two other connections in France. There was no information or any kind of help from the staff as to what was happening to cause this delay other than the plane had not started yet, but that would have been ok. 
They booked me onto another flight (after a 9 hour layover in Paris) which was supposed to get me to Singapore then Aus. After boarding the plane and a wait of 4 hours the captain eventually stated the flight was canceled due to computer issues.
We were then taken off the plane and after 2 hours of lining up we where given hotels from airfrance in which we would have to travel via a train which didn’t run past 1am, awesome news as the tickets where given to us at 1am 🙄. 
After another 14 hours of waiting airfrance eventually left after another small delay with refueling and loading. I was then booked onto another flight to Australia from Singapore with only a 8 hour delay at the airport there. 
I could list 5000 things wrong with this airline from this one experience but that is a small example of some of the highlights.
Horrible unhelpful rude staff, terrible food, poor entertainment and horrible legroom terrible information from the entire Air France team, no compensation (so far), no offers of upgrades or generally anything to assist with what has to be the worst journey I’ve had with any airline ever.

Business seats in our flight to Cancun were outdated, little travel bag poor, some of the crew members too familiar and occupied with themselves (i am not interested who is being retired) - service not bad not good - food not bad not good.  flat beds not real comfortable.  Maybe their C class needs a quick facelift.

When she complained she was threatened to be thrown off the flight.

She was sent to a middle row economy seat because business class was full. It’s a nine hour flight and she came from Frankfurt. 

Air France is overbooking first and business class on ling haul flights. Don’t fall for it!","2019-04-13"
"1","Buyer Beware","Buyer's Beware. Unlike any other airline we have ever flown, Air France has consistently delivered a poor experience from the purchasing of the ticket through the actual flight experience. If you are unlucky enough to have any issue along the way, expect their customer service to be dismissive, rude, and simply unhelpful. 

On one roundtrip from Bucharest to Paris to New York Kennedy, I had my flight cancelled both ways. Delays on every single leg. If this was due to weather or other issues, it would be fine. Except, it wasn't. Air France has mechanical issues on the plane and never communicated that to us. Then they had the audacity to refuse meal tickets and made the rebooking process a two-day affair. 

I fly this route of OTP - CDG - JFK or IAD frequently. I wish, more than anything in the world, that I had another option but Air France. Unfortunately, I really don't as KLM is tremendously more expensive at times. 

Air France. You are terrible. Just an absolutely terrible airline.","2019-04-13"

Second, they don’t have individual screens or movies. On a four hour plus flight, this is unacceptable and “cheap” of them. 

Third, the service is not friendly or helpful. 

Why did KLM stop flying to Jordan?! They are incomparably better than AF, in every way. Delta’s alliance is hurting for being joined with Air France (and Alitalia, too).

If you find any other option, avoid this AF flight! ","2019-04-11"

I had booked 2 economy round trip tickets with Air France directly.  I opted to pay the small uncharge to get seats in the duo row both flights.  Cost total for the 2 of us was $2210.96.  Yikes!!  

We had flown in to LAX on Delta on 5/17/18.  With Delta check in on our first flight leg from Buffalo we were told our baggage would go all the way through to PPT/Tahiti.  We would not have to collect our baggage at LAX for the AF flight.  That was good news to us seniors!

I made a good decision to pay the very small extra amount to get the duo seats.  In these few rows instead of 3 seats in the space there are only 2 seats.  This makes for a bit more comfort (my husband has very long legs at 6'2"" and my legs tend to swell up on flights) and we don't have to worry about disturbing another passenger when we have to get up to stretch our legs, use the restroom.....  Our seats for the 5/17/18 flight were 45A and 45B.  Our seats on the 6/3/18 flight were 46A and 46B.  Plane was a Boeing 777-200 for both flights.

Our flight was AF0076 for 5/17/18.  Scheduled to depart 11:55 PM.  There were very long lines for security as only 1 line was open.  We had TSA precheck but there was no line for the TSA precheck so the wait was longer to get through security.  Check in fine as I had printed out our boarding passes at home for this flight.  There was no gate listed but around 2 hours before departure the gate was listed on the departures board.  

I had bought a bottle of duty free rum and it was waiting at the gate properly packaged for me.  Boarding went smoothly with flight attendants greeting you as you boarded and also to help direct you to your seat. 

Found our seats easily and put carry ons plus my bag of rum in the overhead bin by our seats.  

Flight attendants made sure everyone had seat belt on, seats in upright position, overhead bin doors shut.  Departure was on time.   Safety demonstration.

Snack was offered first.  Orange juice, yogurt, applesauce, roll, cheddar cheese packet, TWIX bar.  Breakfast was a choice of omelet or apple pancakes.  With this you got a fruit cup, yogurt, water, muffin, sliced meat, cheese, roll, butter, jam.  Choice of drink.  We opted for tea.  For airline food this was pretty good.  My only complaint was there was too much and not enough room on the tray to fit it all.

I only watch movies during flights if offered.  There was a good selection.  I watched The Shape of Water and Coco.  

Arrived PPT/Tahiti at 5:30 AM-only 10 minutes later than what had been noted on my flight paperwork.  Smooth landing.  Baggage arrived in fine condition.

Our return flight on 6/3/18 was ok.  It was just so early for me to be at the Faa'a Airport/PPT/Tahiti before 6:00 AM.  This was AF0077 scheduled to depart 7:30 AM. Our baggage would not be checked through to Buffalo as we had to go through Customs upon arrival at LAX.  

There was a long line to get our boarding passes-maybe 30-40 minutes.   I was anxious about the weight of our 2 bags to be checked.  Fine!  I can breathe easy but then the check in person told us our carry ons had to be weighed.  That meant everything-even a purse.  What's allowed is 12 kg each or total 24 kg.  Our 3 pieces were 23.7 kg total!!  Now I really can breathe.

Boarding went smoothly as on our flight on 5/17/18.  Greeting, directing to seats, checking the cabin, safety instructions.  Departure on time and very smooth.

Crackers and drink-apple juice for us.  Then we were given paper menus for our main meal which would be lunch/dinner.  Both options included corn salad & baby veggies with chicken, cheese, applesauce tart, coffee/tea.  Entree choice was beef satay with basmati rice & veggies or yellowfin tuna in white wine sauce/broccoli/buttered boiled potatoes.  Again the quality of the food better than expected.  A small bottle of wine was offered-red or white.  I should note that written on this paper menu it stated that a selection of drinks is available throughout the flight.  Beverages listed-aperitifs, champagne, vins blancs, red wines, beer, mineral water, fruit juices, sodas, hot beverages....  And this was just what was listed for economy.  Our last meal was orange juice, fruit cocktail, roll, Babybel mozzarella Kinder chocolate, drink.  We had tea.  

Again I enjoyed the inflight entertainment of movies.  A Wrinkle in Time, Red Sparrow.

I should also note that we were provided pillows, blankets, and more to make the long flights as comfortable as possible.  Our first experience flying with Air France was enjoyable.  It's so nice to be offered food, drinks, etc. and not be charged extra.  Also not having to pay for check in baggage was nice.  It's probably all built into the price of the tickets but..........   

I would fly with Air France again.","2019-04-11"
"5","Great flight","It was a very smooth fly and we arrived about 15 minutes earlier at Charles de Gaule, our connection was on time and we arrived about 15 minutes earlier to Bergen.","2019-03-28"
"5","Great flights; great service; great perks; great info and staff assistance and communications","This was an inexpensive and very good price for this trip, with a stopover in Paris both ways.  It was really a good deal.

I loved every interaction with this airline company.

The email and internet connections are fantastic  Their ability and manner and method of communicating electronically was superb and efficient.  The staff that I spoke to on the telephone in Tel Aviv, Greece and New York were kind, patient, pleasant and very very friendly and helpful.  They were determined to solve my two significant problems, and they did!!

The flights were pleasant and food was good.

The seats seemed tight and cramped on the Tel Aviv- Paris outbound segment but not on the parallel return part.

It was especially a nice touch that the airline sent movies and magazines to the smartphone on the tel Aviv- Paris flights, which did not have chairback video screens nor audio.

I will definitely fly this airline Air France again: I consider it now my first choice and default option (the layover to visit Paris was and is a bib big bonus)!!  What fun!!","2019-03-28"
"1","Unusable website, no customer support, worst airline ever","If I buy one piece of extra checked-in baggage, I expect to be able to actually take one piece of baggage on my trip. With AirFrance, that's not how it works. At the airport we were told our ticket contained no baggage at all, and they charged us 13000 HUF to be able to check it in as an excess baggage. Then they suggested that we pay for the baggage for the way back as well, because if we do it before check-in, it ""only"" costs 8000 HUF. No one cares that we already paid for it, for both flights. They have a customer service which tells you they don't handle complaints, the only way to reach them is via a web complaint form which they might or might not answer to. I contacted them via chat where a very rude robot asked me to fill in a complaint form which I already had, they just send automatic messages, and you wait for each unhelpful message for 30 minutes. What kind of ""customer support"" has no phone number but a fax number?? And what kind of ""customer support"" is impossible to reach? Never flying with them again, even if they gave free tickets.","2019-03-28"
"2","Not satisfied","Air France is not able to arrange seats together for people travelling together. My husband got a seat from totally other part of the plain. However he was more lucky than I. I was sitting in between two gentlemen who both seemed to suffer from a flu. The other one used a white  cover on mouth  but the other one was coughing more or less the whole 8 hours. I asked  the air hostess if it would be possible to change the place. Probable it was not because she didn’t show up again. I od course got the flu and havetried to cover from it for two weeks. Nice!
We had one piece of extra luggage to check in. It cost 40 € from Helsinki to Martinique and the other way from Martinique to Helsinki 60€. Makes no sense. They even tried to get an additional payment for Paris Helsinki. We refused. A lot of telephone calls were made but luckily we didn’t need to pay anything extra.
The plains are old. Seats are very uncomfortable. Screens are really small like a stamp and do not work propely.
Airconditioning was faint if any. I almost considered asking extra oxygen mask.
Best thing to mention was the small bottle of Martinique rum with food.","2019-03-28"
"2","Dreadful return flight","I don't get it, I just don't get it...Air France is owned by the same company that owns KLM, yet KLM were excellent on the flight out to Shanghai, on the return flight with Air France it was almost appalling.  
Check in was fine and the seat was okay with enough legroom.  In flight entertainment was good and things were clean.  Where it all went wrong was that the flight attendants were perfectly fine for about two hours and then they suddenly got arsey and uninterested in the passengers.  Then the 'food' came and it was awful, even more awful than a pre-packed 59p frozen meal from Heron Foods.  I tried to eat it but just couldn't...and as for breakfast, it was simply vile...so the whole 12 hours I didn't eat.
Very unimpressed and will avoid using Air France in the future and stick to their sister company KLM.","2019-03-27"
"3","Not as bad as I expected, and I was ready to write something terrible!","About 15 years ago, I flew Air ""Chance"" (sometimes vee fly, and sometimes vee don't) back from my other home in Italy, and the food service workers were on strike, as in one brown paper bag of food, even for First Class, and no help in the cabin. By sheer luck on this trip, the AF workers were on strike between my incoming and outgoing flights, and everything was tranquil for me. I had 4 segments in 3 terminals and went to 3 VIP lounges, and the lounges do vary from location to location. I am a loyal Delta Platinum Member, but just another chump on Air France, and I sat in row 31. Boarding for partner VIP members is allowed and well done. I have to say that the food is pretty good in their lounges. One lounge had 5 choices of premium pour-it-yourself wine, and I saw a Saint-Emilion Reserve and didn't even look at the other bottles. Yum, yum! 3 of 4 airplanes were pretty new, and one smaller plane smelled funky. The trans-Atlantic planes seat 10 across, and legroom is marginal. Movies system worked well and there was maybe an inch more legroom than Alitalia, but nothing like the Delta Comfort that I use for no extra cost. I booked Alitalia last year and Air France this year, always through Delta, to save up to six and a half hours of travel time, and the prices were good, too. I am a little bit worried about a lack of security checks with Air France, but it sure was easy. I will also add that France is the melting pot of Europe, and the type of travelers on their planes may be different than we are used to seeing, if you know what I mean. I love my Delta and can't wait to fly them again, but I will certainly check Air France to save both travel time and money, in the future.","2019-03-27"
"1","Worse possible check-in and service, worse than low cost !","It is impossible to check online and chose a decent seat when you buy your ticket what is this manipulation? There is always an IT problem when you check in, so they say sorry you cannot chose your seat, we called the customer service and they had an internet problem. This airline staff is worse than bad, pathetic and incompetent almost a scam. The best part was at the airport when we got rebuffed by arrogant and incompetent staff, telling us: you should have checked-in online, or come earlier now don't complain if you get the left overs. This airline sucks.It is worse than a low cost where the rules are cristal clear. They stuff you with some ticket and pretend they have IT problems to decide where they want you to seat in their sardina box. Be sure we will be flying another one next time. And by the way if our ticket was not expensive enough, we are not the one making the price.","2019-03-27"
"2","Try Another Airline","on 8:15 am flight, had a very poor breakfast shortly after take off. Near landing, 9 hours later, was given a small sandwich, not a full lunch, and had to make a fuss to get wine. Quality of food poor. Movies available extremely limited in terms of recognizable films. But seats good. Oh, couldn't sit with wife because we did not pay extra to select seats ahead of time and seats assigned when arrived at checkin. No way should you have to pay to get any old seat ahead of time.","2019-03-27"
"2","Just Horrible Food","Was woken up 90 minutes for landing for cold coffee and cold omelet. Seats were comfortable. Movie selection extremely poor, only a few films ever heard of. This is not the Air France I remember from a several years ago.","2019-03-27"
"5","Paris break","Very nice service, staff all pleasant, seat was comfortable would recommend, shame it was a short flight","2019-03-27"
"4","Pleasant flight, would fly again","Flew Air France one time from Marco Polo to Charles de Gaul. I would fly Air France again.

The flight was 90 minutes late, but that was fine with our schedule. The legroom was decent, the check-in was efficient, and the crew were friendly. Food and drinks were good, too. Pleasant flight.","2019-03-27"
"3","Convenient for national flights in France","The Flight was short and on time. The ticket was at an affordable price and there was no other option to fly to Marseille from Paris","2019-03-27"
"2","Uncomfortable Seats","I have to agree with other reviewers who say the seats are uncomfortable.  They are so uncomfortable, I would not pay the premium price to upgrade again.  I've traveled in premium economy with other airlines and there is a big difference in comfort.  However, there are pluses to flying in this cabin.  You can select your meals from a special premium economy menu, enjoy faster check-in using the business class line, board early, sit with fewer passengers, watch movies on a larger screen with noise cancelling headphones, and you get more elbow room.  If that's worth the price tag, then go for it.

Our return trip was almost a disaster.  There was a problem with my ticket.  My husband's was fine and we booked both tickets together.  We ended up having to check in with an agent at each layover to get boarding passes assigned.  I am still not sure why they couldn't issue them at the orginating airport but it all worked out. It was just inconvenient and a waste of time.","2019-03-26"
"1","Poor service","I was dying for a glass of water, but the staff served only a part of the passengers, and they were not seen later. I hated the flight.","2019-03-26"
"4","Economy plus","Decided to pay extra for Premium Economy and I must say it was money well spent. When you get to a certain age space becomes very important and these seats were more like business class with a good recline, large screen and excellent service from the cabin crew. If I can afford it next time will definitely travel with AF Premium.","2019-03-26"
"1","Never again...","We took a flight to Mauritius from CDG and return with the same company ( flights AF0460, AF0463 13th - 25th March) please avoid! It seems that Air France is cutting costs on the most basic services: food (pasta with potato salad), aircraft staff ( one steward serving in the cabin on one aisle) aircraft comfort- the plane was old on both traveling ways, the screens were not working properly, coming out of the seat support, the movies and the entertainment part was not working either, it felt that the whole aircraft didn’t have a serious maintenance for quite some time. This is not the feeling that you want to have while traveling overseas on a 11h flight. The stewards were nice but there was no organization at all from entering to the aircraft until serving the meals. We received breakfast with 45 min before landing to Mauritius- people were still eating when the captain announced the landing and we were given the paperwork for the immigration office.

The most distressing part was when we returned and landed to CDG in terminal 2E and connecting with terminal 2F at 5 am - this is when Air France staff confused everyone where to go and it was literally everyone running in front of everyone, pure chaos at the security check. 

Never again! To be avoided!","2019-03-25"
"1","Poor customer service","Lady at the entrance to check-in queue was extremely rude and unhelpful, very poor customer service.
Luckily one of the other airlines was able to assist with our question without hesitation.","2019-03-25"
"1","Rude, arrogant, unhelpful crew and an old flying sardine box as a transport","The lack of service within AF, the arrogance of staff, the transportation between airports and the fact that our 4-year-old got pretty hurt ending up in severe nose bleed due to a very bad and aggressive bus driver, with not even a trace of help to find from AF. And letting a family being stranded for 24 hours without even providing a hotel? Speechless! You should be ashamed Air France!

AF841/20MAR FDF-ORY
-seats 17 ABC, in flight entertainment not working on all the 3 screens, brought to the attention of a very unwillingly, unhelpful and rude flight attendant. 30 min. and 2 flight attendants later the systems were restarted, unfortunately without any success. No follow up by your crew. A 9-hour flight with a 4 year old and no entertainment, a first timer for us. We have never seen so unhelpful crew during our many travels.
-Shower! During take off I got a shower, assuming water as a result of condensation? Coming out of a ceiling light, dripping down on me. As a result, my t-shirt was wet, to be more precise, the whole right side of my shirt and the seat were now wet. I brought this to one of the attendant’s attention, with a amusing answer. That was normal she said and went away. Not even listening or offering any kind of towels or blankets or at least an apology! So, for our next travel on AF we should bring umbrellas perhaps?
-Seats. This must be the industry’s worst, oldest, most worn out and tightest seats! I have never seen anything more uncomfortable than your flying sardine box used for this flight. Disgusting!
-Food. Please reconsider your portions and quality of food, this is rather ridiculous. Small servings, ice cold bread and very little to choose from.
-Service. I understand AF is doing the “we are here for your safety” thing, but seriously, there is a total lack of customer service and crew is rather rude and arrogant, not even close to service minded. If you want to stay in the industry you should really pick up your game. On a 9-hour flight I went myself to get my own coffee, or at least I tried, and was told of to wait for the second service which will start in about 30 min. Really?
-Breakfast. When we finally got the so called breakfast, we were informed that we had 20 min to eat and drink up. Wow, speechless, again.

Arrival at ORY
-Waiting for more than 1 hour for our luggage.
-Bus tickets to CDG. Where could we possibly get them? Ask some staff in the arrivals, wait, there was nobody. Went up to the AF ticket desk (this is where I got them at CDG!) to be told no, they don’t do this here at ORY and I had to go to arrivals. I informed them that there was nobody, but this was not their problem of course.  After some searching, I found a AF lost and found office and finally I could get those bus tickets. Your information around the obtaining of these tickets is ridiculously poor and I cannot understand why this is not provided in the ticket.
-Bus. Huge queue, we made it on the 3rd bus luckily. The driver was probably angry with the traffic, which was bad, and drove very aggressively, sudden accelerations and sudden hard breaking, absolutely unnecessary aggressive driving behaviour. This behaviour resulted in our 4-year-old hitting her head and nose on seat and window, resulting In severe nose bleed. Let me tell you, AF staff was not even slightly interested to listen to us or helping us. This again shows the arrogance which we met all the way. Shame!

CDG
-Our flight, AF1640/21MAR was long gone and we were redirected to the manual check in. Here we were told to take the next plane, which was starting boarding as we spoke. Boarding passes were issued, and I allowed myself to ask if we would be able to make our connection in AMS. That was not the lady’s problem of course, how could I. We just had to run to the gate we were told, which we did.
-At the gate we realized that we had 3 different seats, far from each other, meaning that our nose-bleeding 4-year-old will be sitting alone, beside a male stranger. As we all know, this is against aviation law, so I approached the gate staff. No surprise I was told off again, we just had to take those seats because the aircraft is full. I brought my daughters age to the staff’s attention with no effect, its either that or we are not going anywhere. She now added they will try to solve the seating issue on board.

Onboard AF 1740/21MAR
The cabin crew was not happy that we did not have the right seats and the discussion started all over again. We were then told that we had to talk to passengers ourselves. Shocking. We convinced 1 lady to swap seat with my wife so she could sit with our daughter.

AMS
-Arriving late in AMS, we ran to our next gate in hope to catch the connecting flight to TRD.
-We arrived at the departure gate 11 minutes prior to scheduled departure, but there was no one to be seen in the gate. We saw the aircraft and our 3 bags nicely aligned in front of it. With other words, we were offloaded already before we even arrived.
-Contacting the transfer desk and being told that all flights were full, booked on the same flight the next day.
-Asked for a hotel and was told of course, we will be provided a hotel. However, after a phone call to her supervisor the lady tells us no, she cannot provide the hotel and we had to pay ourselves and claim it from AF later on. We didn’t even receive an IRR kit and had to buy our toothbrushes, toiletries and some clothes for the next day. How can that be?

As a very frequent traveler I advise everyone to avoid this very airline, it is in times of service recovery you learn how good or bad the airline is, and believe me, Air France is by far the worst we have experienced in all those years with 100's of flights.","2019-03-25"
"3","Sweet and sour","My husband and I took the same flight on two different days. He had checked bag and lost it in the transit. He had to wait for 4-5 days to get the bag back. On the other hand, I did not have any checked bag and everything was fine.","2019-03-25"
"5","First time with AirFrance","AirFrance has a great service, tasty food and choice of drinks on board. Our economy class experience was great. On-board movies, music, flight information also was great entertainment. From Miami we upgraded seats in front, and that was a good experience  again.","2019-03-25"
"4","First time in Premium Economy","Premium economy was so much better than I expected. I've been in business class on several flights and this was comparable. The breakfast could have been improved and our seat didn't recline or slide forward, so sleeping was difficult. I did like the foot rest and the audio/video program was excellent.","2019-03-10"
"2","Worst airline ever?","The ticket prices were very reasonable.  Took shuttle flight to Paris then long haul to Jo’burg. The long haul flight was on Airbus 380 but it was the worst leg room (and seat tilt back) I have ever experienced on long haul flight.  The cabin staff were fine but the food very poor and breakfast totally inedible. I thought the French were famous for their food?  The entertainment system was very outdated and choice of films poor.","2019-03-10"
"5","Flight to Madagacar","It was long flight from Europe to Africa, it lasted around 11h, service was OK, staff were helpful. All in all OK but still it is not as good as Turkish or Qatar airlines","2019-03-10"

"4","Helpful staff","Unfortunately both my husband and myself required assistance this time and were unsure about how this would be.We need not have worried as the help we were givThen was first class.The flight was on an A380 and we were very lucky this time not to suffer much turbulance.The crew were all very pleasant and helpful too","2019-03-08"
"1","Better avoid","Pretty old aircraft and seats were uncomfortable, very limited leg room. In spite of asking for veg food I was provided with non veg items, when I called the air hostess I was told that is all they got. Forcing me to eat bread, cheese and some yogurt - leaving the main course. Plus the flight was delayed and re-routed to NC, it landed at Charlotte for re-fueling and back to Atlanta - overall 3+ hours of delay, we missed our connection to Tampa. No accommodation provided, booked our own room at Atlanta to catch next days flight.","2019-03-08"
"5","Great A380 flight","Great flight in Business Class on the Air France A380. I had heard comments that the seating was not up to scratch but I tall and was very comfortable. Service and meals were wxcellent","2019-03-08"
"4","Great Service","We paid for the upgrade of Business class. It makes all the differences in the world.
Board first, lay down seats, better food, better service and better restrooms.","2019-03-08"
"5","comfortable, safe, ontime","I have flown Air France several times as part of a Delta partnership when going to Europe and India. Never any concerns for safety; staff very friendly and professional; seats good for economy.  I do all bookings online through Delta, so I get some Air France and some KLM flights to India.","2019-03-08"
"4","Timely service & good food","This was 2nd leg of our Clermont-Hyderabad flight and as ever, Air France is reliable in its service and communication. No hassles at all. Everything was smooth and on time. Food & beverages in the flight are good enough and standard service.","2019-03-08"
"4","Perfect as expected flight!!!","Flight was as expected. Took off on time arrived ahead of schedule. The girls on check in were fantastic and served me with a huge smile, the cabin crew were fantastic bent over backwards to help and they should be commended!!! All good, only fear I have is of Brexit. They only negative I have came from some of the other passengers. Few people can be very rude and it was evident on this flight especially on landing. I can never understand people's hurry, seatbelt off before plan lands, locker open, massive bag(s) out and wanting off the plane before the door is even open, not happy if it's not done quick enough, then they need to wait at the carousel. You have got to laugh some times you really do. I know this happens on most flights and I can't quite put my finger on why it stuck out so much on this one but it did, and it did in a big way!!! Manners cost nothing give your fellow passengers and the flight staff some respect.","2019-03-08"
"3","Getting better, but still so much to learn!","As much as the flight crews are generally pleasant, Air France has had the worst customer service on the ground of all the airlines I have flown in the last four decades.
There are signs that competition may progressively dissolve the usual contempt that one suffers when checking in. Smile! Be helpful! Travelers do pay your salary.","2019-03-07"
"5","A380 Airbus from CDG to ORT","In general, I am not a particularly good flyer.  I flew Air France from Heathrow to Charles de Gaulle, Paris, and was impressed with the friendly and relaxed (and attractive) cabin crew, and the service provided.  At CDG, I transferred to Air France 
A380, and, imagine my surprise when everyone was seated, that the female voice which came over the intercom was the Captain, and she further announced that it was an all-female flight crew.  Being somewhat chauvenistic, I was a little taken-aback by this news.  However, I am thrilled to report that the take-off was the smoothest I have ever experienced, so much so that it took me a while to realise that we were already in the air.  I would say, too, that the flight itself was the smoothest i have been on in 50 years of air travel.  My clincher was that my suitcase had been severely damaged.  I entered into correspondence with Air France over the matter, and had excellent customer support from their staff.  I cannot speak too highly of them.  And i was fully compensated for the damage to my baggage.","2019-03-07"
"3","Disappointing business","Difficult and complicated transfer from arrival terminal to departure with special assistance Paris airport is badly organized and not clean.
Air France hopper flight was ok and staff pleasant, even though not appropriate(walking outside with rain)for wheelchair passengers in Paris and Basel Mulhouse airport
Mistake to book business: same service seats and food","2019-03-07"
"4","Very good business service","Excellent experience from boarding to arriving: decent seats, entertainment system new, food good and pleasant service. Upon arrival in Paris wheelchair available as requested","2019-03-07"
"4","Not many options","There aren't many options flying from Houston to Rabat if you want to avoid overnighting somewhere in Europe. The AF connection was the best and the flights were fine with good service and good equipment. Typical of many European Airlines, except for very long flights, ""business class"" means regular seating at the front with an empty seat between you (although there is upgraded service). My main complaint about flying into and out of CDG is the frequent requirement to take a shuttle to the terminal from a remote location. I figured flying AF that wouldn't be a problem, but, sure enough, our full A-330 was parked remotely and shuttled in. The flight to Rabat was fine. All flights departed and arrived on time.","2019-03-07"
"3","Economy Premium is a rip off","As finance are sometime made with up&downs, I was in a down and selected Premium Economy for this night flight instead of Business.  I am tall (1,95m / 6.3ft) and love leg space so if I could not afford to fly  Business class I choose PE. 

Definitely PE seats are small as in Economy. They are slightly larger but as far as leg space is concerned it is the same : nothing. To talk about the reclining of the seats : it's a joke! You stay seated upright all night. It was a real red eye flight!

Next time if I am still broke :-) ,  instead of running for Flyingblue miles, I'll select an alternative airline.  But Premium Economy for a night flight never again!","2019-03-07"

"4","Great food, poor supervison of alcohol service","The food was exceptionally good.  I have tried Business Class on about 8 or 9 different airlines and Air France food was far and away the best.  On the other hand, I was seated next to a man who entered the plane apparently sober and was allowed by the cabin staff to consume so much alcohol that he became a major barrier to my enjoyment of the flight.  He would not allow me to sleep.  He dropped things on me, talked to me despite my being reclined with an eye mask on, knocked my phone to the floor, generally made sure I did not sleep.  I arrived in Saigon tired and unrefreshed.  The cabin crew were generally charming, but they completely failed in any kind of responsible service of alcohol, and I was the one who paid the price.","2019-03-06"
"5","Air France flight to Florence","My boyfriend and I flew Premium Economy. The seats were so comfortable! We were given a little pouch that had socks, eye mask, tooth brush and tooth paste. We had a small menu to pick our food from. We were given a free glass of champagne and a small bottle of wine. Felt like first class. The flight attendants were very nice and very attentive.","2019-03-06"
"1","Poor Air France service","Our flight was delayed by 12 hours due to staff not having adequate rest between flights. We were only informed about this some 24 hours before the flight. This is the second time we have had poor service on this airline.","2019-02-26"
"5","Great except the food","The Boeing 777 B class is very comfortable, the food was not up to expectations.
Movies choice quite varied.
Seating ensures privacy and full sleeping position.","2019-02-26"
"4","Easy check-in at last!","This was our first flight with Air France and it was a nice surprise.  With a common sense approach to boarding on our first flight, they started with families and then boarded the plane with the rear seats first.  I've never experienced this before but what sense it made!

British Airways should take note - free tea/coffee and a small snack (a pack of madeline cakes) on the way out and a sandwich on the return.

Both flights boarded and took off on time and the staff were friendly too.  All in all, fab!","2019-02-26"
"4","Legs?","I was travel with group, Belgrade-Paris-New York and return was Miami-Paris-Belgrade
I am sorry but do not remember No of flight, or type of airplane, but people...WHEN was started to be almost impossible to park your legs how close seets are?? :((
Is there some rule for that? I am ""short"" and it was not easy, but high man beside me, commmon....he's legs was in passage. Sad.
Food was ok, service, flight, time..all other things
","2019-02-26"
"5","Great airline","We flew economy to/from Paris with Air France. 
Both flights were on time, the seats were comfortable with ample legroom. Cabin crew very friendly 
We were pleasantly surprised to be offered complimentary refreshments. 
Would definitely recommend Air France and would pick them over BA if flying the same route.","2019-02-26"

"5","The crew, the service, the process, all thought out very nicely.","This was a case of the little things came through the loudest. One example. On a red eye flight with the crew pretty much done for the night, a buffet was put out for all the passengers so they could wander up and get a snack or drink. Simple, not on United or American.","2019-02-26"
"5","Trip to south africa","Good service, good meals and food.  Lots of in flight entertainment.  Would travel with them again no problem","2019-02-26"
"2","So disappointing","I hadn't flown Air France for a long time and this flight was a real disappointment compared to my memories, the plane (Boeing) was old, the screens did not work and when they did the definition was poor, even worse I had to change seat because my seat belt was broken !! The flight departed and arrived on time, that was the good point and the crew was ok.","2019-02-26"
"2","Most uncomfortable seat","We paid extra to sit in the row with only two seats at the back of the plane. The location on the plane was fine but the seats are terrible ergonomically. From the minute we sat down we could not find a comfortable position in these seats. I fly many airlines and these are hands-down the worst seats I've sat in and we had to endure for a transatlantic flight.","2019-02-26"
"2","Not happy with Air France this time","Quite uncomfortable seats for a long haul. Me and my wife were given seats in different rows. Even if we were at the airport three hours before the flight, at first we were told that it was impossible to change. Only after some discussion, we were seated together. Food was a disappointment too (one could expect better from a French airline).","2019-02-26"
"5","Excellent flight","On time both departure and arrival, staff freindly and at tentative  during outward and return trips would us them again and recommend them to all","2019-02-25"
"3","First Joon's flight (TXL ---> CDG)...","I would like to share my experience flying with Joon, a subsidiary (low cost) airline owned by Air France. I did arrive at Berlin Tegel Airport (TXL) approx. 7:35 am for 10:05 am's flight but I decided to spend time walking around at the airport before heading to check-in counter at 8:15 am.

When I approached Joon's ticket counter, I just realized there was quite a long queue. The queue was not really visible from distance as it was partly covered by another (long) queue in front of KLM's check-in counter which was located right next to it. I spent a good 45 minutes before I reached the check-in counter.

During the check-in process, I was happy because the staff asked me to check-in my hand carry luggage with no extra charge as the flight was almost or completely full that morning. Waiting area is basically behind the check-in counter but we had to pass the security check area before being able to enter the area.

Boarding was prompt and efficient. Our flight departed on time and again, it touched down at Charles de Gaulle's Paris Airport on time. Overall, it was quite a good flight -well, it was a no frill airline so that no food nor beverage was served during the flight unless you pay for it.","2019-02-25"
"5","flight attendants are very friendly","The flight was delayed for a couple of hours due to bad weather at destination, Nice France. The flight attendants were very helpful and made the delay much easier to stand for.","2019-02-25"
"5","great experience, (1st time in an A380)","the waiting room in MIA airport before boarding is not the best & nicest I know, but correct. And that's not AF responsibility.
It was my first time in an A380, even if I'm a frequent flyer. AF crew was great & friendly, food was good, the premium economy seats are great even if not perfect for sleeping, but I think it's because I'm very tall (the leg support below the seat was useless for me)
Transfer OK (even if I hate CDG), flight CDG > MRS on time, nothing specific tos share.","2019-02-24"
"4","Cuddles","I really enjoyed to fly Air France, all flight attendant were super kind and smiling. Food was delicious and amazing choice of movies and tv shows to kill the time. Usually I fly premium and its also comfortable.","2019-02-24"
"5","Excellent Flight and great team","Your day will start with a smile from the luggage drop off at Air france till you ll leave the plane at your arrival, be sure that they will make their best to make you confortable …!
I always enjoy flying with Air France, it s even more than a pleasure … nothing to worry... they ll make it easy for you","2019-02-24"
"2","A nightmare to book and rude staff","We booked our flights almost 9 months ahead of time. At the time of booking we didn’t realise that we made it without luggage. So we added 2 bags to our booking. And there the pain started. For some reason the system changed these. Of one of the passengers and did not add it to the booking. So we had to call AF help desk or customer service 6 times to get it fixed... everytime we called they said they couldn’t find it and than they would fix it. Surprise surprise when we arrived at the airport the problem still wasn’t fixed... so it took 30min and several phone calls from the staff to get it fixed. Flight from LHR to CDG was on time but flight to Lyon was delayed by 1 1/2 hrs... on the return we had still the same problem and the check in staff was totally unprofessional and unhelpful. (The manager was)... the fact that I got upset because by now the problem wasn’t fixed... that they couldn’t retrieve the luggage bookings, telling us we hadn’t booked any and basically telling us we tried to cheat the company (the guy couldn’t be bothered to look at my 2 pages of printed bookings to see the confirmation or receipts) Nobody took responsibility or even said they were sorry. Both flights were delayed and it was obvious to everybody that they had to look for excuses why there was a delay. Cabin crew couldn’t have been friendlier and helpful. 
I am a top tier flyer with Staralliance and do 10 long hauls a year at least but never been treated like that ( no I have no status with AF but I expect just plain competent and polite service)... I will try to avoid them as much as I can...","2019-02-24"
"4","Another Visit to South Africa","I have flown on Air France many times in the past to South Africa because it has convenient connections from my nearest airport ( Birmingham ) with a short connection at Paris Charles dear Gaulle. The reason for choosing Air France is because they fly the Airbus A380 which has duo seats ( two seats together ) all be it at a slightly higher cost than standard economy but a lot less than premium economy. These seats are on the top deck so is well above the engines so slightly less noisy than standard economy on the bottom deck. I always try to get the seats directly behind the bulk head which is row 88 and gives slightly more leg room than those behind. The food on board the flight was good although they do not always have your choice from the menu. There is a good choice of beverages. Departure and arrival times are nearly always as stated on the itinerary which is another reason why I choose Air France and always will be my first choice when I choose to Fly from Birmingham for the connection. Price is not cheap but is competitive with other airlines.","2019-02-23"
"2","Long flight in poor conditions","The 1st leg of this flight (unfortunately the longest part) was dreadful. The limited space was made worse by the passenger in front (who was quite heavy) reclining his seat suddenly. He split my drink over me and was unconcerned. I was extremely cramped and when I eventually reclined my seat so that I could see the screen, the passenger behind was obviously unhappy and kicked the back of my seat continually. 
The staff were pretty indifferent throughout the service and all the food provided was of poor quality. When we left the plane the cabin crew were chatting amongst themselves and did not acknowledge the departing passengers. Never seen this before with any other airline.

The last part of the journey from Paris was completely different - a really charming crew. Sandwiches were served and these were of good quality. Much better experience but sadly, we will avoid AF in the future.","2019-02-23"
"2","Lot of Things not Working","We were lucky the fight was not very full. We had to move from our seats because TV screens not working. Several other passengers had same issue. The food was not that great. I have made many trips with other airlines and I would rank this near the bottom.","2019-02-10"
"3","Business seats, business tarif, but not the service and standard","Overal service ok, but no longer the selective business standard as before; boarding; all economy passengers have to pass the business area, seats and space smaller 3 in a raw,food good. Special assistance service did not work out in Paris, in Charles de Gaulle airport no Air France employees to help you all outsourced to a group of people that could’nt care less.","2019-02-10"
"3","Big delays","I had delays to Paris and back to JFK so they had to put me the last minute on other plain. Without the ability to chose my seat and without providing  me with the spacial meal I have ordered one my 1st  flight ","2019-02-09"
"1","Worst experience","First, you are treated like sh*t by checkin staff if your cabin carry on plus your small backpack is over 12kg... NO OTHER AIRLINE DOES THIS... FYI I am silver on Air France and 3 other airlines, and travel with the same luggage around the globe since 10 years... Ground staff is arrogant and not helpful... then you have to pay for extra weight above 12kg (they finally realized that I was French so did not have to pay but still had to check my carry on in). I WILL NOT FLY AIR FRANCE AGAIN. And BTW, I am French... not proud of my national airline...","2019-02-09"
"3","Confort minimal en classe Economie","Long line to drop luggage.
Seat very narrow and very minimal space with the seat in front.
Food not at all tasty and almost cold. White wine very cheap.
Minimal service even skipping the digestive!
The stewards are spending far more time selling duty free than offering you drinks or snacks.
For a fourteen hour flight, we will have appreciated a better seat and more space!","2019-02-09"
"2","Flights cancelled and poor connection issues","Not allowed to check in for my flight as it was delayed and I had a short connection in Paris. Poor weather the issue. As I explained I would rather be stuck in Paris than Madrid. I handed my hire car in and there was a taxi strike in Madrid as well. Got changed quickly to a KLM flight which was good","2019-02-08"
"5","One of the best European Airline","Air France is one of my favorite airline in Europe. Professional staff, modern aircraft. Boeing 777-300ER provide free wifi for messages. Catering delicious. CDG airport well planned. Warmly recommended airline mostly for long-haul flights.","2019-02-08"
"1","Appalling","Don't really know where to start, on the Gate priority booking, did not happen. I complained and the response was.. Whatever!!! On entry to cabin, it was the Old 2 - 3 - 2 có fig not the herringbone which is advertised on their Web site. The common entry meant all economy passengers were routed thru.. With the usual sarcastic comments. No welcome drink until I asked. No WiFi although again this is in their flight magazine. Food and drink OK but so it should be. Nothing as good as the Mid East carriers, it was good economy food. To be fair the purser got me the spare seat alongside. I will not be paying £400 for an upgrade on my return. Nor will I ever fly Air France again","2019-02-08"
"5","Tired, older aircraft","I was surprised to learn that Air France still have about 30% of their fleet waiting to be upgraded to the much improved newer business class seats, this flight had the older side by side layout that does not even go fully flat, however I still really enjoyed my flight because of the 80-year old lady in the next seat.  To say that she likes to travel would be an understatement!  She kept me entertained for much of the duration of the flight, retailing me with stories of her exploits and travels.  Of course, being an Air France flight the food was really good, as was the quality of the champagne and wine selection.  But, what really made the flight for me were the members of staff, they were superb. Air France should be very proud of them.","2019-02-07"
"1","Discriminated Against by Ticket Agents","On our recent travel from Portland, Oregon to Paris, France (with our ultimate destination being Corsica) on December 21, 2018, we were scheduled on Icelandair Flight 7634 (operated by Alaska Airlines as Flight 905) from Portland to Seattle, which was canceled due to mechanical problems.  We were rebooked on Air France flight 0077 from Los Angeles to Paris.  Once at LAX, we approached an Alaska Airlines agent named Zach, explained our situation, and presented the flight confirmation paperwork given us.  He looked in the computer at our ticket history, then excused himself to go and confer with Alaska officials.  He soon returned with our paperwork and wrote the reservation reference number for our Air France flight (BWOAOV) along with his name and phone number (Zach:  310-665-1460), as well as the original confirmation code from Alaska of V7A73U.  “Please have them call me if there is any issue,” he said.  “There should not be a problem.”

When we approached the Air France ticketing desk, we were met by an agent who scrutinized us closely as we handed her our paperwork and passports.  Looking at the computer screen, she immediately shook her head.  “The flight is completely full,” she said.  “It has been for three months.”  “Then how could we get a confirmation number?” we asked.  “I don’t know, they must have forced the reservation,” she said. “Forced?”   She shrugged her shoulders and regarded us with a cold, unsympathetic, and slightly contemptuous air.  At this point, my wife broke down in tears, having not slept the night before and stressed out of her mind over the whole situation.  We urged the Air France agent to call the Alaska agent at LAX, pointing to his phone number on the paperwork.  “No, we are not going to call anyone.  It is not our policy to call,” she said.  “Your only options are to fly standby or look for another flight.”  Two other Air France agents stood by, offering no support.  With my wife in tears, the first Air France agent ordered us to move away so others could approach the desk.  The agent then walked away and disappeared behind a wall.

We moved to an adjacent desk where another Air France agent briefly looked at our reservation and then said she could not help us.  Finally, a third agent came to the computer to work on getting our luggage removed from the Air France flight that they would not let us on.  At this time, another passenger then approached the Air France desk—an African American woman, who told the Air France agent that her flight had been canceled and that she had purchased a Business Class ticket on Air France flight 0077 to Paris.  The agent told her that she couldn’t possibly have a ticket because the flight was full, “completely full,” she added.  “Here,” said the woman, holding forth her cell phone.  “I have the reservation confirmation right here from Air France.”  “It’s not possible,” said the agent.  “The flight is completely full.”  “Look,” said the woman.  “There were 3 Business Class tickets available on this flight, and I purchased one. I have a confirmation from Air France right here on my phone. I need to get on this flight,” she said, handing the agent her passport. 

At this point, my wife said to the woman, “That’s interesting.  We were told the same thing from the Alaska Airlines agent in Portland.  There were 3 Business Class seats available, and she reserved 2 for us.  You must have booked the 3rd one.  Something is going on here.  This is not right.”  We looked at one another in the way that people do who believe they are being lied to.  The Air France agent suddenly appeared nervous and said, “Wait just a moment.”  She then disappeared behind a wall.  
After a short time, the Air France agent returned and provided a boarding pass for a Business Class seat to the woman passenger, offering no explanation as to why a seat had suddenly become available.  No passes, however, were extended to us.  Instead, an Air France supervisor approached us and reiterated what the first agent had told us:  we would need to fly standby if we intended to try and get on our flight.  We pleaded with her to please call the Alaska agent, Zach, who had confirmed us for the Air France flight.  She told us that it was not their policy.  She also said how our original tickets were Economy Class, not Business Class, which could not be honored.  When we said that Alaska told us they would pay the difference in fare price, she said that this does not always happen, and that they have the right to decline a partner airline’s reservation for rebooked flights.  Given that our standby chances were better in economy class than Business Class, we then asked if we could be put on standby for economy class, too.  “You would be willing to fly economy?” she asked.  “Yes,” we explained, reiterating that we had connecting flights to catch to ultimately reach Corsica and catching those flights was the priority.  She then told us to wait while she took our reservation paperwork and disappeared.  Fifteen minutes later, she reappeared with 2 Economy Class boarding tickets for the Air France flight.  Again, no explanation for how 2 seats just magically appeared on a flight that had supposedly been full for 3 months. One seat was near the front of the plane and the other way in the back.  When we asked if it was possible to be seated closer together, the Air France supervisor said that we could not change seats.

Once at the gate, we decided to check one last time whether we could be seated closer together.  There were 2 Air France agents, one of whom had previously been at the ticketing counter.  My wife approached the other agent and asked if he could check to see if other seats closer together were available.  The agent who had been at the ticketing counter then said very rudely, “You were told that you could not change seats!”  She then busied herself with helping another passenger.  Thankfully, the other agent did look at seat availability and found two seats in adjacent rows.  He then reassigned us to these seats.  Again, for a supposedly full flight, there appeared to be numerous seats available.  
    
In all respects, this was the most degrading and frustrating flight experience we have ever had.  With our carry on bags being small backpacks and neither of us wearing business attire, it was clear to us that Air France agents profiled us and engaged in blatant discrimination.  And it is equally obvious that Air France agents discriminated against an African American woman and were not going to let her board Business Class until the three of us caught the agents in their lie.  Even more than the discrimination, however, was the pain of witnessing other human beings (and airline professionals, at that) being so mean, hurtful, and disrespectful to other human beings.  How much does it take to pick up the phone to resolve a situation for stressed-out passengers just trying to get somewhere?","2019-02-07"
"2","Disappointing","The start itself was bad. A long que for Business class travellers/Sky priority. The on board service and food was also very average.","2019-02-07"
"4","Good service","I had recently traveled on an Air France plane and it was a good experience. The leg room was not much but was acceptable for the economy class. The seats can be a problem as they do not recline much - if you're flying economy you should be not expecting to get the best seat available on the plane, right?
If you are bored, there are plenty of videos, musics and even breathing exercises in the entretaining system - they offer earplugs.
The staff was kind and helpful, they served two meals during the flight, both of which were good - I wasn't expecting to have French bistro level...
I would recommend flying Air France. 
As of for check-in, I'll make comments on a situation. My flight was canceled and I was not informed by the company. Actually, I was awared of it because I myself searched the flight status on the website. Thankfully, I was in advance as it took almost five days for them to solve my problem and realocate me in another flight.","2019-02-06"
"1","Never again","We were on a long haul from Mumbai to Charles de Gaul airport, 10 hours. 
I don’t sleep much on night flights but after the pathetic hard wrap that I couldn’t eat because it was burned. We apparently had to sleep. 
So the lights all went out and I watched a mediocre film, no new releases that was advertised in the sky magazine. 
I tried to turn on the over head light to read my book and they weren’t working so I tried the crew call button, that didn’t show up above the seat so assumed wasn’t working. 
I went right to the back of the plane to look for someone and there was no one, I assume they had all retired for the night. 
So I sat in the dark for more than 6 hours. 
An hour before landing I had asked to speak to someone. The manager came and was constantly shouting me down as I was trying to tell her. “We turn off all lights as it’s a night flight and everyone goes to sleep” well I don’t and I dare say there are a few like me. 
I have complained and all I got was some vouchers towards my next Air France flight. I really don’t think that is good enough as we paid extra for our seats and don’t intend to go with Air France again","2019-02-06"
"3","disappointing","terrible flight attendants. We see them just once for the meal, and once for the breakfast. and in-between they just seat somewhere. you are just allowed to pick a snack from time to time.
the most disappointing was the entertainment choice. mostly old and not interesting french movies.","2019-02-05"
"1","Think of other company ","I don't recommend to fly with Air France at all. The planes are old and the food is very bad. We hoped to have better food.
Besides, we left a luggage and it was never found, even we reported it missing 15 minutes later. 
Had better experiences în the last flights with other companies. ","2019-02-05"
"1","Refusal to admit liability for incompetence in Baggage transfer","The flight from YVR Canada to CDG Paris was delayed by about 30 min on 10-Dec-2018. This coupled with delayed wheel chair travel resulted in missed connection flight from CDG to MAA, India. 
Air France Customer Service at Terminal 2E rebooked our next flight scheduled to depart 11 hours later and assured the baggage will be automatically transferred. 

But Air France not only failed to transfer the baggage, but also failed to send it even on next day. After my complaint, they sent it on 3 day and I received it on 4 th day.
The response from Customer service towards my claim for for purchase of essential clothing (supported by receipts) is really disappointing. Even though Air France's negligence was well documented, they refused to admit responsibility and tried to make me contact the last airline that delivered i.e. Air India ( though it is not at all their fault). Still Air India offered a limited compensation. 
When I tried to claim the balance from Air France - again they refused and instead asked me to contact my travel insurance. All these took FORTY FIVE days and still not resolved.

I am not sure if any Senior Management member of the Air France will see this review or other departments (like audit) will see this and take it  to the attention of Senior Management.","2019-02-05"
"3","Not standardized methods","My wife and I fly with our dog in the cargo area . There is always something different, but never in our favour . We fly to Valencia in Spain, but have to lay over in CDG, where we pick up our dog and wait for our connecting flight, although our luggage always goes directly to Valencia (VLC) . Well,  this time the supervisor in Montreal wanted to give us boarding passes ONLY to CDG, being that we were 3 people, including my 85 y/o mother in law . We had to almost kneel to beg him not to do that, but nevertheless he ""allowed"" my wife and mother in love to have all their boarding passes, but not me, since the dog was under my name.  Of course, due to all the problems with fractioned flights, we lost the plane to VLC because our dog's carrier was broken by their personnel, and had to patch it to continue our flight.
In all honesty, they put us in the next flight (7 hours later) at no charge, but in CDG people wanted us to place our complaint through their website, but ended up ""doing us the favour"" (I hate that behaviour) of placing it through them","2019-02-05"

We flew Montreal to Charles de Gaulle then connected to air Europa to Malaga. Service on Air France was great...though it’s never clear with your meals what is included and what is not (ie alcoholic beverages). Our return flight was Air Transavia from Malaga to Amsterdam (Schipol)..it was windy coming in for a landing and a little rough...not much time to get through airport and security to our connecting, but not panicked either. We then connected to KLM to Montreal. We spent the extra and prebooked our seats on the longer flights...well worth the money spent!","2019-02-05"

Pre-departure lounge had great selection of snacks, even though it was a bit crowded.","2019-02-05"

"1","How to JACK passengers!","From LAX to Paris, CDG Airport: Flight was bumpy, that's understandable. 
Food: Pack your own food!
Service: Poor. They had us going to the food service corner to retrieve our drinks and snacks instead of giving the food and beverage to us.
Flight Attendants: Not friendly!

Flight from CDG to LA: Flight was smoother. 
Food: Pack your own food!
Flight Attendants: Friendly and served our food and beverage. We were on the upper deck, you would never feel any different regardless if your at the lower or upper deck during the flight.

Our flight AF0076 was cancelled, that's understandable. But the way they handled scrambling to accommodate us could have been handled better. First they said the computer down, to wait for 30 minutes which turned to hours. They told us to sit and wait while they find out what's wrong with their check-in program because without this check-in program we cannot board the plane. Thirdly after about 3 hours they had us board the plane and once we all were on board after an hour, they had us get out of the plane because now LAX program won't allow us to deplane (get out of the plane once we land at LAX).

I'm a heart patient and I specifically asked for bulkhead seats due to my condition. We prepaid for our seats to and from Paris, France. DON'T PREPAY for your seats because they won't accommodate you! At LAX leaving for Paris the counter lady accommodated me for a bulkhead seat because she realized I'm a heart patient. Due to a cancelled flight from CDG Airport from Paris to LAX, we opted to sleep at the airport because of so many changes with their cancellations, we didn't want to risk missing the flight AF0066 from Paris/CDG to LAX. I pleaded for a bulkhead seat because I'm a heart patient but they had to separate us to accommodate me alone. I opted for our assigned seats instead so if something happens to me my family would be there to monitor me if something were to go wrong with me while on flight. Not good!

DO NOT BUY FLIGHT INSURANCE! That's an upsell to trick-f*** you into spending more money. 

DO NOT PREPAY FOR YOUR SEATS! Again, that's to trick-f*** you to spend MORE money!

MAKE SURE YOUR CARRY-ON LUGGAGE CONFORMS TO INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT MEASUREMENTS! One of our carry on was an inch too long (the wheels) so I pleaded to the counter lady that we prepaid our seats going to and from to at least give us a PASS on this carry on. NO CAN DO, SHE SAYS! WE PAID 50 EUROS THAT'S 57 USD! for a carry on luggage! Another way to trickf*** you into spending MORE money!

Overall, AIR FRANCE I WOULD NEVER EVER FLY AGAIN!!!

ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10 WITH 10 BEING EXTREMELY SATISFIED AND 1 BEING EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED? WHAT DO YOU THINK?! I'D GIVE THEM A RATING OF -10!! IF THERE EVER WAS SUCH A RATING!!

DO NOT FLY AIR FRANCE!!!

FLY ANOTHER CARRIER!!!","2019-01-20"
"2","Business class flight from Vietnam - more like economy!","Booked business class as a special treat for a holiday to Vietnam.  Flight out to Vietnam was with Vietnam Airways and it was superb.  Complete luxury, fantastic food and excellent service.  Unfortunately Air France changed the return flight and we had to fly back from Vietnam Air France.  I have never been so disappointed.  As you would expect, I couldn't wait to see my own little pod with all the business class treats you get when paying three times the ticket price.  The plane we were told was old so the set up seating arrangement was a two, three, two which was more like an premier economy than business class.  I had to wake people up to visit the toilet and the food was dreadful.  Infact it was the worst flight I have ever taken and I have flown a lot.  I will never travel with Air France again - a real disappointing end to our amazing holiday.","2019-01-20"
"3","Fine airplane, bad food, bad service","The flight was fine and the airplane was in nice condition. However the food was terrible (no flavor and did not sit well in any of our stomachs) and the flight attendants were moody and rude to us. I went back to go to the bathroom and the flight attendants got mad at me for being in their way. I did not feel served in any sense and the experience was definitely sub par.","2019-01-20"
"3","Ok...","I hadn’t flow Air France before but I was expecting a little more from a full service airline. It was ok. The flight was fine but the staff could have been more friendly.","2019-01-19"
"3","Improvements required, surprised by previous quality of reviews. ","My flight from Tokyo to Charles De Gaulle was very underwhelming seeing at Air France have a number of good reviews. I believe they are in the top 10 best business class, however I would disagree. I must state as in a previous post my first experience was with Qatar on four flights totalling 24 hours in the air! 

The airport lounge in Tokyo is nice sharing with other airlines no problem there. The welcome onto the flight was very friendly and the staff welcoming from start to finish. The cabin itself was very clean lots of seats in the business section I think around 48, too many? Based on other flights I think that the seat wasted lots of space other airlines like KLM give the passenger more space I felt it was quite cramped. The compartment was on my left and my immediate support was that it was too big. Sleeping was not an issue I had a good 8 hours sleep bed was comfy and pillow very good. 

The breakfast was very good taste, quality and amount were all where you expect. The Dinner has three courses the starter and desert were too a high standard the main was below average. Large lump of beef, hard to cut, two carrots and two sugar snap peas with small potato gratin. Most of it was tasteless a sauce was supplier which was okay made it nicer. 

Entertainment was pretty average I could only pick 4 movies that I would consider watching and ended up not watching any the whole way through. Lucky I had plenty of time sleeping instead! 

I would say KLM was better than Air France moving forward I would choose them. Overall they supplied the goods all round, although lounge in CDG 2E was very good.","2019-01-19"
"1","Unethical Business Practise","We booked for our family vacation on France months in advance. We chose Air France not for the price but for schedule and how it would fit into our holiday schedule. We saved for more than a year for this holiday and was pretty excited when it was about time to fly. Imagine our horror when I received an email 24 hours before our flight saying 'Your flight was cancelled'. It took my husband to go sit in the  Air France offices the whole day to save our holiday. First of all the lady did not even know the flight was cancelled and then she tried to book us on very inferior airlines. Eventually after a battle and some unpleasant words from my husband we were booked on Emirates. The flight was the day before we were originally meant to fly. All this happened after we received an email saying we should choose our seats and print our boarding passes. We were assured that everything was in order with the return flight. Well, the morning of our return flight, I received the same email 'Your flight was cancelled'. At least this time we did receive emails of our re-booking on other airlines, BUT my daughter was booked on a completely different flight from us. We decided to cancel all our plans for the last day of our holiday to rush to the airport to sort the mess out. It seems to me Air France is selling tickets for flights that don't exist. Never again Air France!","2019-01-19"
"5","joon the low cost for millenials","We flew with the brand Joon actually. Which is the ""low cost for millenials"" from Air France. We actually didn0't notice the difference between them as we checked in with Air France and all the services were from them.
We had a very nice flight","2019-01-19"

as with most domestic flights, queues form early for passengers carrying (additional) carry-on luggage, and this flight within the EU is no different. service and seat space were decent.

upon arriving in Heathrow for our transfer, 3-4hours till our next international flight out, we had to queue for 2hours at immigration, we were lucky to have made our international flight in time.","2019-01-19"

Ayala Champagne in the lounge but food offerings not great. On board Joseph Perrier Champagne and other wines were excellent as was the food and service. Layover at CDG had very nice lounge with a good food offering and the chance for a shower to freshen up after the over night flight before continuing on to Barcelona.","2019-01-18"
"4","Surprise when they offer us food and drinks & you could bring 2 luggage.","The flight was smooth due seats a little wider than other Airlines.  Staff attentive to your needs.They offer you  wet/warm towels before they offer free food and drinks,  you could watch a selection of movies, shows that entertain you for the long flight. . You are
allowed to carry 2 big luggage, 1 carry on luggage and your purse/book bag with you.  ","2019-01-18"
"3","Decent price but pretty average business class","Flew from Lagos Nigeria to London Heathrow with a transit in Paris Aeroport for new years holiday. I booked air France cause the price was lower than other airlines & i thought why not try another airline. The planes were pretty average, most of the reclining buttons were not working and I noticed a few passengers testing out different seats to see what was working. Movie selection was lacking. I pretty much just closed my eyes & slept through the 6 hour flight cause who wants to stay up sulking. Overall I'd probably fly with Air France again if I find a cheap ticket but not because it's  an amazing airline","2019-01-18"
"4","A good one","AirFrance usually gives you a pleasant experience. Food is good, crew members are helpful and gentle, there are nice options of movies in the system (should have more subtitles in Portuguese to those ones that does not speak French and/or Engilsh, given the high number of Portuguese people in France - and Brazilian tourists).","2019-01-17"
"3","Service Level tanking - Family not in focus for Economy travelers","The flight took of late and landed a bit late in Paris (first leg of the journey) - we had to scramble to catch our second part of the flight. We were a set of three people and Air France simply did not take the effort to keep us together (and upon request at the counter also stated they were ""Sorry"" but could do nothing - but on our return flight Air France did help once in flight).  Summary - If you buy economy flight for a group - high likelihood of being separated .  The food quality has significantly deteriorated - a collection of packets of food thrown together carelessly. The kids simply refused to eat the served food  - 90% of the food was wasted.","2019-01-07"
"4","Sort out the details","Check in and boarding fast and efficient. Seats adequate with ample space. Food mediocre - fish dry and tasteless for dinner, crepe for breakfast tasted old and rubbery, not up to the usual high standards.","2019-01-06"

Offering they’re service every single time , smiling and playing with our little one . Offering to warm up food and providing us with a small pillow for the little one.
Plane was clean and very comfortable .
Thanks Air France","2019-01-06"
"5","An excellent Trip from Frankfurt to Miami and back in December 2018 with Air France and Delta Airlines..","The Flights in Europe are usually bellow 2 hours and the service are generally quite limited.  Air Frances Service was above average. The best of the whole travel was the experience at the Charles de Gaule Airport in Paris, which is the great experience due to the outstanding architecture, shopping possibilities and interior design, facilities, services and French flair. I used this flight as part of a transatlantic flight Frankfurt - Miami - Frankfurt which included four parts: 1 - Frankfurt - Paris; 2 - Paris - Miami; 3 - Miami - Atlanta; Atlanta - Frankfurt. In spite of the two stopovers it was a great experience basically due to the excellent airport services offer by Paris and Atlanta Airports. I will make 2 reviews: one for Frankfurt - Paris - Miami and one for Miami - Atlanta - Frankfurt. The second part from Paris to Miami was excellent for all the aspects involved for a passenger and specially due to the Airbus A380 Aircraft and the excellent service.","2019-01-06"
"2","French Gastronomic Image Damaged","""Wow, they are going to serve us a nice bite to eat"" was our impulsive reaction flying Air France from Paris to Copenhagen. But what a disappointment when we tried to swallow their 2 day old, cold, and completely dry ham and cheese sandwich with no taste at all. Improve it or Stop it if you do not want to ruin your country's gastronomic image.","2019-01-06"
"1","Bad service","Flew from Johannesburg via Paris to Tel Aviv business class all the way. Had a FIVE hour connection in Paris. My suitcases did not arrive. had to wait until the following morning to receive them.

"1","Terrible service","What a shambles of an airline. Business class normally get priority boarding, this was free for all.  When they brought the goody bag around only female bags were left.  After take off it took an hour to bring us a drink. When we were asked for our food selection not everything was available they had run out. The service was so slow it took a total of 95 minutes to serve the meal. 
When they woke people for breakfast they virtually threw it at you and then hovered around to pick the tray up because we were coming in to land. 
I always complained about BA but never will I moan about them again. Air France you are a disgrace","2019-01-06"
"2","Expect nothing more than a budget airline","Air France used to be one the best airlines in Europe around 20 years ago. In the recent years it has become a low quality budget airline. It used to serve the best meals and now only pasta or chicken with no hard liquors. Legroom is terrible. On board entertainment is poor even in long distance flights. Paris airport transfers between terminals are handled by bus which is unpleasant during frost or showers. Security check at Paris airports are very slow and time wasting. There a lot of things they should improve but don't expect anything better with this mentality.","2019-01-06"
"4","Long time user says go for it","I have been traveling with Air France since 1992. I also traveled with Islandair, KLM, Finnair, Aeroflot, United and even China Southern. This was quite exceptional for us, an overnight flight on the 31st of December (got a good deal on Business tickets). Unfortunately, nothing special was done about New Years Eve in there. As usual, the French accent of the captain speaking English was hilariously bad, but that was not a big deal for us - we speak both. The crew was nice. Not to sticky like Japanese or Arabic companies. You like it or you don't. Good English speaking. One thing I would improve is the non-flatness of the seats in the sleeping position. It does not allow one to sleep sideways. The plane was a recent Airbus A380. In a few words, it was not exceptional, but as always with Air France, there was nothing bad to complain about.","2019-01-05"
"5","Excellent flight!","So nice to fly Air France again! Unfortunately it will be Delta on the way back. I am ever hopeful that everything will be fine . The flight was comfortable the attendants very accommodating and attentive as I always find them to be on European and Asian airlines.

"4","Certainly one of the best long haul carriers","I use Air France all the time. I’m a platinum club member and their long haul flights are generally some of the best in the Sky! Not always perfect but their air prices are probably the most competitive in the Sky. Fly business if you can always worth the extra and far cheaper then other major carriers.","2019-01-04"

"1","Worst Airline","Ground crew at JFK were fine.  Problems started on the plane.  I have traveled on multiple European and Aisian airlines and English language skills were quite good, Air France crew is barely competent in English and some speak none.  For the most part the crew was rude.  Once meal service was over crew disappeared and don’t try finding any of them.  Food for a French airline was horrible, excess salt, undercooked rice, underripe fruit, hard rolls.  Outbound, breakfast was an almost frozen muffin.  On the inbound trip, a passenger had mold on her roll and trying to tell the flight attendant was an exercise in futility.  
My mother and I were in wheelchairs and we were abandoned near the assigned gate.  Trying to let the crew know, we were assisted passengers got us brushed aside 
because we were no longer in the wheelchairs. 
On the inbound flight, my brother had a problem with a passenger, who happened to be French, and the reclining of her seat and even after nearly spilling his coffe, he was made out to be the bad guy.  
If at all possible I will never fly Air France again.","2019-01-04"
"1","Avoid Air France at all costs","A late cancellation on Delta caused me to be re-booked in Air France from LAX to Paris, then Paris to Budapest. Delta assured me that Air France was a partner airline, so everything would be a smooth transition and I would enjoy the same extra amenities I had paid extra for with a partner airline. WRONG. Air France couldn’t care less about my priority status with Delta. The couldn’t care less about the extra money I paid for the upgraded seats. They acted like they didn’t want any of us on their airline at all. We got stuck in horrible middle seats in coach for the overseas flight. Once we got to Paris, their customer service got even worse. No one on the plane could tell us where to go for our connecting flight and questions about our luggage, and told us to go to customer service. We went to 3 different customer service desks until we finally found one that was open (this was mid-day on a Saturday). And by open i mean with only 2 employees sitting at a desk with 10+ seats/cubicles for employees. The line of people needing help was a dozen or more. One employee quickly left and never returned, leaving all of us waiting in an impossibly long line. Once we got to speak with the Air France employee, they directed us where to go and assured us our luggage was being loaded on our connecting flight. We got to the gate and the agent again confirmed our luggage was being loaded on our flight. When we got to Budapest, surprise surprise, there was no luggage. Air France had managed to lose the luggage! The Air France customer service employee in Budapest didn’t give a crap that they lost our luggage and refused to help. We had to go to the airport lost luggage department and file a claim. Fortunately, our luggage eventually showed up. Air France was horrible and I hope I never have the misfortune of dealing with them again.","2019-01-04"
"2","La Collection Air France: Inflexible et chere. Il est clair qu'Air France ne sait rien des voyages à Cuba","The flights were OK but we would have been better off had we booked them ourselves we would have at least been able to change them. 
The same might be said of the hotels. 
Transfers in Cuba were horrible and it is very clear that the have no experience of traveling in Cuba. 
We booked a 10 day trip visit advertised as an opportunity to Havana and to spend a few days on the Cayo Ensenachos. There is only one hotel on Ensenachos an all-inclusive luxury resort popular with Canadians but really an alien enclave 50 km away from the real Cuba (the main island). Transfers were organized so that Havana would become merely a transit stop-over, this was not communicated to us before we left, the schedule was blank and there were no people who could change anything in Cuba. Prior to departure we had tried to obtain information from La Collection Air France but this proved to be  miserable and futile. In the event we traveled in the bus from the airport to the Havana hotel and the early morning bus 32 hours later to Ensenachos. Everything else we booked and paid-for ourselves.
In conclusion the value of booking through the Air France agency (La Collection Air France) was extremely negative - they make you buy expensive exchangeable tickets which cannot be changed, they book hotels and don't tell you when you will stay in them and prepare a ridiculous schedule that you don't find out about until you ask the staff in the hotels in Cuba. 
The La Collection service is border-line criminal and should be avoided at all costs. I am sure that Air France will blame their travel partner in Cuba but upon enquiry we were consistently told that all of the planning was done in France and could not be changed in Cuba. Horrible, horrible horrible!
The flight out to Havana was fine but the connections extremely short, on the way back Havana to Amsterdam was miserable and one of our bags did not make it onto the last leg of the flight from Lyon to Biarritz (we were in Lyon for over  3hr).","2019-01-04"
"4","Air France weighs and strictly enforces limit on carry on luggage at CDG airport","Mass transportation is what flying is about these days.  Do not have high expectations unless you travel in business or first class.  My last flight was fine and the crew did a good job.  Air France however does something that distinguishes if from its competitors in an unpleasant way: at Charles De Gaulle Airport, the airline weighs your carry on luggage (two pieces allowed: bag and purse, for example) and STRICTLY enforces a 12 kg (25 lbs) limit.  If you go over, you are required to check the baggage in.  Based on its ticket prices, Air France clearly does not consider itself a ""low cost"" carrier and should therefore stop this practice.  Please note that I was not affected by this and am writing this review just to inform unsuspecting travelers.","2019-01-04"
"1","THIRD RATE AIRLINE","My 18 year son Aayush Agrawal had to fly today evening by Air France to SFO from Mumbai early morning flight of 5th Jan. He is alone and not very conversant with flying complexities. 

The check in staff first told him he is on standby. My son has to report for his college so he requested to be accommodated. Then the staff has arranged for him a Jet Airways flight upto Paris and asked him to collect his SFO boarding pass from staff in Paris.

The Jet flight leaves only a 2 hour transit and all of this will get used up in organising a boarding pass and rushing for the next connection to SFO. All this on a Business Class ticket from Mumbai. There will be no time for any freshening up in such a long journey.

All this because the staff in Mumbai could get away with all this. Completely unacceptable and shoddy.

"2","Avoid Air  France and Chas de Gaulle at all costs","Changed fight times after booking meant ridiculous connection times at Chas de Gaullle which has to be the most backward airport in europe . Then a flight delay because of incoming flights meant a sordid stay over night in paris to make an early morning connection to Nuremberg. Return from Nuremberg- un notified gate changes there and in paris meant last minute rushes . Compensation for the prepaid hotel in Nuremberg applied for in August and still no response or repayment . A general style of charming staff but incompetent insouciant  management.

The flight was good value dual badges withKLM nowadays.  Every aspect was as good as expected. Very attentive cabin crew without being too much.  Food was great, well it’s Air France after all!  The layout of the pods give you plenty of space for the journey and at 6ft 2, I found I could stretch out comfortably for sleeping.  Overall arrived refreshed and relaxed. The other benefits are that you seem to get over any jet lag quicker and start enjoying your stay straight away.  So although we’d like to save on the cost of flying it’s an expense worth paying.  The quality of the care and the experience make it worthwhile.  So thank you 😄","2018-12-20"

I'm not terribly tall at 5ft 11 just average the seats are far too close together you do not have any legroom whatsoever . They have squeezed so many seats onto the plane it makes for a very uncomfortable flight also the seats themselves are very very narrow . I personally will never fly with this airline again after thirty five years of flying this was by far the most uncomfortable flight I have ever experienced . my advice avoid Olympic and airfrance like the plague .","2018-12-19"
"3","Recommend for long-haul flights","Good entertainment, 2 meals and good overall service on long-haul flights. You get a lot for your money. The personnel is very polite.
On shorter flights the personnel would start to bother about your bags, and how they should be stored in the overhead compartment, although there was no issue with your bags in the 7-hour flight. Personnel is less polite on short-term flights. There is no entertainment, and no meals, and planes are not really clean.","2018-12-19"

"3","Air France serviced by Delta is a long trip across the pond","When flying to Europe or anywhere out of the country i always look for an international carrier, saw this was Air France, by Delta.  I went on the incorrect assumption that it would be a larger, better equipped version of Delta regional flights, even cross country.  Very little legroom, very little offered for food without a hefty price, they charge for movies, albeit only $5.  

The staff was friendly, the flight was on time, which is why i give it 3 stars.  It was adequate, but nothing above.  

Flying coach/economy on British Airways to London, or other overseas destinations easily gets a 4-5.  I would pay a bit more money for a truly international flight.  Since this is about the same time as flying from Boston to California, i think they don't up their game at all.","2018-12-19"
"5","Excelent choice","The flight was direct. It was on time. The service on board was nice and attentive. We faced some strong turbulence during the flight but the pilot and attendants managed to transmit calm to everyone.
The price was reasonable. I bought places with extra space, it was worth it.
All in all a very satisfying trip","2018-12-19"

"3","Avoid Charles DeGaulle Airport if possible","In - Flight service was generally adequate but our seats had old food wrappers when we arrived and were less comfortable ( they do not fully recline  to a somewhat flat bed ) in contrast to other airlines like Delta or United.  Gate staff was rude, unknowledgeable  and generally unhelpful. They miscalculated the time to switch gates  by  more than one hour and showed a serious lack of understanding of airport  operations.   We missed a connecting flight by less than ten minutes and had to wait 11 hours for the next connection.  Unless your final destination is Paris I would avoid Charles DeGaulle and  make the connections elsewhere.  We hear Amsterdam for connections is much better.","2018-12-17"
"5","Service and food were excellent","The service and food were excellent on my international flight and return flight from Atlanta to Paris.  I required a wheelchair on my return flight due to an accident in Lebanon and the service from Air France staff was excellent.  I will definitely recommend Air France and fly them the next time I need to go to Lebanon or Europe!","2018-12-17"
"4","Flying is tiresome but AF makes it a bit better","We absolutely haven't found the formula to sleeping on a plane but Air France was quite comfortable.  Even the babies didn't cry.  But why do airlines not board back to front? They would improve their on time performance and protect the business/first class passengers from rolling baggage impact!","2018-12-17"
"4","Would be a full 5 star perfect if not for the omnipresent French strike threats","The seating is almost the level of business class, and the friendly service and good food and wines definitely matches. The only drawback is that with the French unions, one always has to work with the risk of a strike.","2018-12-17"
"3","Flight ok, food yuck!","The flights to and from Paris were smooth and pretty comfortable in my aisle seat. But the food was horrible. I’m not too picky but I couldn’t even tell you what some of it was. They served risotto of all things. Bad choice. If I fly them again, I’m taking a PB & J from home!","2018-12-17"
"5","Superior customer service","My initial flight was delayed, making my connecting flight impossible to catch.  The customer service agent at ORY arranged all of my transfers to CDG and personally made sure I made my connecting flight in time.  Great service!  Unfortunately I didn't get his name...

The food was also great on the flight - first class!","2018-12-17"
"5","Very relaxing flight,","Fantastic staff on both journeys ,we wanted for nothing always checking to make sure everything was going fine with us ,and that we had everything we needed, Highly recommend air france","2018-12-17"
"5","Friendly and helpful","I always travel with my cat Amélie in the flight cabine, and they always give us priority passes enabling us to be one of the first to board.","2018-12-17"
"4","Good leg room","I flew to Paris with my son who is 6’3. I booked bulkhead seats on the way to Paris so he could really stretch out and sleep. Definitely worth the extra $50! On the way back, we had regular economy seats and he was okay. I found the flight comfortable and the crew were pleasant and professional. I book early so the price was the same as a charter airline, but the service/food was much better.","2018-12-17"
"4","Pleasant flight","Air France can sometimes be hit and miss. But this time they delivered. A full flight for people  who were  going home for Thanksgiving. The service was constant  there was always something to nibble on keeping in mind it it's a day flight.   The entertainment is not quite up to date considering   you are spending about 8 out of the 14 hours awake.  
I can recommend  Air France. I enjoy flying. Them. They so have a few moments of real excellence. Then mostly very good.","2018-12-17"
"5","Fly AirFrance you won’t regret it!","Best all round flight, crew, food and beverages, comfortable seats, attention to everyone and everything!","2018-12-17"
"5","Love this airline!","Friendly, efficient, and professional service!  Food was very good and lots of entertainment selections, especially French movies.  I fly Air France whenever I can.","2018-12-17"
"4","Beautiful place. Beautiful space.","This was our first trip to the heated. We flew on Air France from Los Angeles airport. The flight was great but the food was so-so. I would recommend an upgrade if you want better food. Some of the food was prepared from a can such as the fruit cocktail.","2018-12-17"
"4","Best way to fly to Japan from Europ","My favourite way to fly to Japan is the Paris to Haneda flight that leaves late at night. I find I sleep ok on the plane, and again when I arrive in Japan, and then I am ready for my trip. Best hotel to stay at is the one that is inside Haneda airport terminal. What could be easier! If traveling by train there is a ticket office at the airport. Beware though, the queues can be quite long as people get their Japan Rail passes. I've flown to Japan 3 times a year for the last 10 years. Since I discovered this flight I always try to book it. Seond best is Finnair from Helsinki because it is the shortest duration.","2018-12-17"
"1","A Flying Circus","The grund staff comes 20 min late to the gate meaning the boarding starts 20 min late ? 

and we took off 20 min late but the captain told another story why we took off not on time

On board 5 passangers directly behind me are loud and very obvious have been drinking MUCH, they move around shake my seat and my rows seats this is 20 min before take off and I see an older Pursher looking at them 

Great he got it under controll !!!
after take off the same old pursher comes by and give them champange ??!! Meanwhile in my row the tv screens dont work so we told a stewart it´s not working he anserws soon 5-10 min we let the staff to know again and again even the old pursher we told them 5 times 
1 hour later no tv
Nobody from the staff came by asking are you ok is the tv working 
In my row we took turn to call for attention and help Dinner service is over and the 5 passangers start to drink from bottles of there own and getting loud again and more drunk. When the old pursher come to offer us new seats beacuse tv not working I try to tell him they are drinking from there own bottles indirectly you cant know how much they drink and asking if this is ok for safety and the level of loudness
Sir are you saying I cant give them newspapers ?? Trying again this is an old staff member with I guess long experience and why so bad English or pretending he cant understand me ? next minute he is back with 5 pure rome drinks to them meaning he knows them
this is no Platinum member in economy that get a complementry drink

What can I do I got a Pursher giving extra alcohol to passangers behind me they are loud drunk and can drink open with out any of the staff telling them NO  

This is a flying circus 😱

I´m a gold member and pursher is offering me to change seat beacuse my broken tv to a exit seat I fly 10 times a year and know it looks good but is super Cold, no thank you 
something else got nothing I know on this flight the are 10 seats free in premium economy  Im a quality observer asking him again can´t you offering me something else due to the 5 passangers is drunk and loud and me as I gold member the dinner service is over that would be a nice treat

once again he don´t understand me or what I want

asking him if you don´t understand let me talk to your staff that speak Scandinavian He never got back to me so I Went looking for this person

What is wrong with AF second time in 3 months I find very bad mangemant a head pursher in busniess that totaly ignore passangers same here The old pursher ignore me and all other passangers 
around row 15 in safe and sleeping comfort","2018-12-10"
"1","Liked France, until we landed in Paris.","Upon landing in Paris from Boston, we were greeted with never ending security checks.  Even after purchasing duty-free gifts inside the terminal, we had to pass through more security, where the personnel unpacked the duty free items, scrutinized them, and handled them without care. On the way back, we missed our connected flight out of Paris, and were met with rudeness and disrespect at the ticketing office from the Air France employee when trying to change the ticket.  She refused to properly check the tickets, and did not want to do her job. After I had made an inside joke to my wife about our luck, the employee threw my papers back at me, saying that if I want to laugh, I can look for help at a different place.  In the time it took for me to apologize and straighten out the situation, we missed our second rebooked flight out of Paris.  Overall, aside from the human made troubles, the airport itself is confusing, unaccommodating, and lacks amenities, like a nice place to sit and enjoy a peaceful meal.","2018-12-10"
"3","Everything is premium except the seat","Premium economy on this AF route gets you the same expedited  check-in, security line and boarding as business class, so that’s good.  There’s a little amenities package on board , a separate cabin and attentive service from the cabin crew.  Also good. 
But the seat itself is horribly uncomfortable - it ‘reclines’ no more than half an inch and the foot rest is essentially unusable.  It feels like they selected the seat design without anyone ever sitting in it !","2018-12-10"
"4","Still good","Still one of the best options considering comfort  and cost benefits but quality of services, food and drink has decreased  in the last years. Flight attendants are usually kind but it depends of the flight. Pre booking of seats is expensive and more than once I saw situations where people had to change seats because of people who didn´t ckeck in previously. Attendants usually piroritize maternity criteria but what about people who pay a lot for the seats in advance ? ","2018-12-10"
"2","Brutal","Our flight left at 6:20am so we got to the airport at 3:30. The lights were all off in the airport but the queue was already very long. The automatic kiosks were turned off but of course we, and others tried using them. At 4:00am workers arrived and turned on the lights and several kiosks opened. The long line contained people trying to check into two flights, one to Amsterdam and one to Paris.
Someone came along and directed people for Amsterdam to form another queue. They were attended to first. Their flight left at 6:00am.
We finally got checked in efficiently with a friendly attendant. 
We managed to get our flight to Paris.
Our flight was 2.5 hours 6:20am-8:30am and we were not served anything at all, even though our tickets said breakfast.
Switched planes in Paris and finally caught our flight to Vancouver.
","2018-12-10"
"2","It’s when there is a problem you really know if it’s a good airline","The flight was fine, typical airline experience, nothing more, nothing less but it was when they lost my luggage that I was dispointed.  I was traveling with 2 friends, we were all on the same itinerary and checked our bags at the same time.  It was short 1 1/2 flight from Paris to Nice but once we arrived my bag did not.  Initially I was impressed the service gal as she knew exactly where my bag had gone and said it would be in Nice in a couple hours and to my Airbnb by 2pm.  We only had 3 days in Nice and as we were there for our Thanksgiving holiday, had dinner reservations at a fancy restaurant 7:30pm. Since we had to be back by 2pm we when to Castle Hill since it was close to the Airbnb.  We got back about 1:30, by 3pm we called AirFrance and were told now it would be between 3-5.  By 4:45pm we called again, they gave us a different number of the company they use for delivery, we told them we had 7:30 dinner reservation, they were rude and said now it would be by 6pm.  Six came and went, we tried calling again, after tons of run around finally got someone that said it would be between 7-9pm!!!  The bag did finally arrive a little after 9pm.  Needless to say, we had to cancel our dinner reservations, ended up having pizza delivered and wasted a whole day sitting in our Airbnb!  It was very disappointing that they could not be a little more service oriented and given us an accurate time rather they making it a moving target!  If we they would have said 9pm to begin with we could have had the whole day, made our dinner reservations and still been back to be there in time to get the bag, instead they cause us to waste an entire day of our precious vacation.","2018-12-10"
"4","Good flight","The flight was very nice, it departed and landed on time, the cabin crew was professional, the plane felt safe, no turbulences, the take off and landing weren't tought, I recommend the airline, they are pretty ok.","2018-12-10"
"2","Moved our seats and separated us","We will never fly Air France again. On the way down they separated my partner and I and gave our seats to another couple? We bought our tickets 10 months before. The flight attendants really didn’t care but asked someone to move so we could sit next to each other. Check your boarding pass in LAX while checking in- very sneaky. We had much better service on Delta coming from Boston to LAX. The 777 was older and flight attendants were fair. The return flight wasn’t much better and on my side I had a flight attendant with an attitude. FYI they tell everyone towards the back of the business class section they are out of beef but if you complain, they magically have it! Happened on both legs! We weren’t impressed.","2018-12-09"
"2","Ok","I was disappointed this time with the seats not reclining.  Have flown them before but just not the superio service I am used too.  Not up to their usual excellent standards.","2018-12-09"
"2","Old plane, disorganized staff.","The plane was old stock, the entertainment system did not work well (crackling sound and dated controls). Every leg of our four flights was delayed departing and the food was substandard. The pre booking of seats was expensive (130 Euros) for 3 out of 4 legs of our journey.","2018-12-09"
"1","Retracting my last review; I spoke too soon.","I fly frequently with Air France and my experience on flight AF1835 from Berlin to Paris is so far the worst in all my travel years.
An air hostess took my hand luggage away because the luggage hold was full and there was no more space. I asked how I would locate my luggage because it was not tagged and she herself refused to tag it but insisted on taking it away and demanded that I take a seat(The flight by the way was delayed by more than 20mins because of this luggage story). 

Apparently my luggage would be waiting for me on a carousel at CDG airport which it wasn't. Till today, the 9th of December 2018 I still do not have my hand luggage and all my valuables that were in it.
The people I have addressed this with have either been very rude or very unhelpful and couldn't be bothered about my luggage. 
I am shocked at the service I have received so far, just shows that all you are to the airline is just another seat number.","2018-12-09"
"4","Economy from Paris to Athens AF1532","I sat in window seat 11F and there were two other people next to me.  Seat was comfortable but it had no entertainment system.  Flight from Paris to Athens was only about 3 hours long.  Food and service was good as usual for Air France.","2018-12-08"
"4","Premium Economy from Vancouver to Paris AF379","The service and food was very good on the flight as it had been with other Air France flights that I had flown.  I enjoyed the extra space in Premium Economy and the entertainment system which had a good selection of movies.  Their supplied headphones were very comfortable.  Flight arrived ahead of scheduled time.

For the main meal, you had an option between two different entrees from a menu.  A pillow and blanket were provided.  An amenity kit containing a toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, eyemask, earplugs, and headphone sleeves was also provided.","2018-12-08"
"3","Usually Good Service but Below Expectation on Flight AF374 from Paris to Vancouver","I usually enjoy flying Air France and I have flown from Paris to Vancouver before with them.  This time, the service was below my expectation of them.  I sat in Premium Economy and I enjoyed the seating and the entertainment system which had a good selection of movies.  Their supplied headphones were very comfortable.

The flight attendants were friendly and courteous but weren’t as attentive in the meal service to me as previous flights.  Twice during the flight they skipped serving me items that were part of the regular meal service.  I am hoping that this was just a one-time aberration and not an ongoing situation.  Other than this, I was happy with my Air France flight.","2018-12-08"
"3","Strict Carry-on Restriction on Athens to Paris Flight 1033","I had only a carry-on duffle bag as luggage which I had travelled from Vancouver to Paris to Athens with no problem.  For my return flight in Athens, as I sat at the gate for my Air France flight to board, an Air France staff member requested that I check my duffle bag instead of taking it as carry-on.  It was slightly oversized but this was the first time that I was forced to check my carry-on.  They were also checking other passengers’ carry-on for the same flight.  The staff member was courteous about the situation.

I had book premium economy for the round trip flights between Vancouver and Athens.  I sat in economy for the Athens to Paris segment since there was no premium economy section.  It was only a 3-hour flight from Athens to Paris.  There was no entertainment system on the plane.  Breakfast served on the flight was only mediocre compared to meals on other Air France flights that I had taken.

I usually enjoy flying Air France but this flight segment was below my expectation of them.","2018-12-08"
"4","Had not travel on Air France for over 30 years.","Each passenger has a headset and eye mask, blanket and pillow are standard. Pillows has two design. For this sector catering has a choice of chicken or vegetable risotto. I choose the later one and half way through my dinner cabin crew brought another tray of bread and ask passengers if we want another one. 
An hour before landing each passenger has a nicely designed bag with bottle of peach purée, sandwich and cake. Forgot to mention the headphone is the best I had use so far. Impressive service overall.","2018-12-08"
"5","Great service off and On board","Confortable plane 777-300. Excellent service and meals on board. On time at departure and in advance t destination. Blanquet, Pillow, Headset and eyes cover on seat automaticly.","2018-12-08"
"5","They keep you busy and offer lots of snacks, food, and cocktails too!","Air France is a great airline and the crew was terrific! Lots of games, movies, and shows to keep you busy. Everyone had a blanket and pillow on their seat...so I didn't have to ask. Offered us cocktails, wine, and snacks....all free. Handed out earphones, refreshing wipes, more snacks, a meal, and more. Plane was very clean and bathrooms were well maintained.","2018-12-08"
"4","Consistent good service from Air France...and the meals are unbeatable!","We have flown Air France a few times. This time, we flew from Toronto to Casablanca (connecting at Paris) round trip. Both flights were punctual, service was attentive, and there were 3 meals between Toronto and Paris (8 hours). A hot meal was also served for the short haul between Paris and Casablanca. Entertainment (I only checked movies) selection however was a bit limited. Boarding at Paris was fast. We queued up to board, and only need to tap the boarding pass on an electronic device and straight to the aircraft. This replaced the step that an attendant took the boarding pass, scanned it and checked the monitor, and handed it back to you. Overall, we enjoyed the flights. Will fly Air France again.","2018-12-08"
"1","Overbooking and Lost bags","I was on a business trip with another four people. Bear In mind that each on them has their own sectors of work and duties and I was in charge of the whole team. When we came to Paris I was the only person who had a seat on the plane to Accra… Why? Because of overbooking! The flight was overbooked for 7 tickets! Not 1, not 2 but SEVEN!!! Ok. AF did their best and found one place for most crucial member of my team and we went to Ghana. But they failed to get his bag on the plane…
Next day the rest of the team arrived. Again one bag is missing.
On the flight back to Moscow AF lost my bag… 
Great. The planes are old as I don’t know what. The have the ashtrays. Do you remember any smoking flights? I do and it was million years ago. No power socket to charge you device… Food is so-so, not good/not bad…
The best part is their personnel- always willing to help. 
To draw the line – If you have strict schedule and meeting plan and you do care about your time try to avoid this company at all costs.","2018-12-08"
"4","Good company and smooth flight with the A380 to Paris CDG to Johannesburg","Smooth departure in windy weather, thanks to the massive A380. The food served was acceptable and during the night, service was continuously available. Sufficient legspace and clean toilets. Check-in on Paris CDG is a horror with the self-service system they use. If you manage to print your luggage ticket and your boarding card yourself, pay yourself a drink !","2018-11-21"
"5","Excellent service on board","The flight was easy going and service was excellent, as well as food and beverages. The seats are comfortable, but luggage compartments need an update as some don't close.
Bathroom is maintaned clean throughout the flight.","2018-11-21"
"1","Joon , young company in the Air France group but already on the bad tracks of Air France","My connection was late (45’ delay over 1h15 connection). Nobody cared at the AF arrival and departure (10’delay but no information). The flight is not full (Premium and Business) but the crew used the empty seats to upgrade 4-5 PNC flying to Mumbai in eco rather than trying to satisfy some customers offering an upgrade for miles or better free (I am Platinum). I have seen this unacceptable behavior also in AF before.
The captain came to my premium eco cabin to welcome the PNC (2 young ladies) but ignored the other passengers (also seen in AF).
I didn’t lock my seat belt on purpose. The plane is driving but no check so far. Interesting safety concern.
I think Joon should understand that passengers satisfaction is not only wearing cool clothes.","2018-11-20"
"1","Avoid Joon AF","It is great to be friendly but the Joon style of Salut les Copians is invasive.  Extremely uncomfortable seats.  In business class you can technically incline the seats but in reality no as the seats are too close together. The person sitting behind has their knees touching so the 3 hr flight one pays an elevated fare but the seats cannot recline.  The only difference is the food platter which is inedible. If possible Joon AF should be avoid .","2018-11-20"
"4","crowded and nosiy","legroom is not enough. Baby were crying but no one care. It was noisy. There was red wine for drink. Not so good experience.","2018-11-20"
"4","Air France - A very pleasant experience!","I was visiting France for a week with my wife. It was a leisure trip to visit our daughter and I wanted a reasonably priced comfortable flight. Of the many options available, I selected Air France, first because of the ease of booking on their web site and the competitive rates available.
I must admit I was a bit apprehensive as I was flying Air France after a very long time and had not heard anyone having a recent experience.

The experience was an extremely pleasant one. To start with the Check in at the Toronto Airport was fully automated, but with staff available to help instantly. We were thru with the Check in process in a very short time.

The boarding process is good but a little consideration for senior citizens would be nice. Waiting in long lines to board for us senior people can be a challenging experience. I am sure there is a way to accomodate senior people and let them board early, is possible.

The flight was very comfortable, considering we had a standard seat, that we pre-selected on payment. I was quite happy with the leg space in this standard seat. I am so glad I did not opt for better, but paid seats.

The food was very good. We had the choice of Vegetarian and non Vegetarian,and both were of very good quality.

The in-flight entertainment is another aspect that was a pleasant surprise. We had an excellent choice of movies and music that we thoroughly enjoyed.

The bathrooms were sparklingly clean and well kept. It was pleasure using those facilities.

On top of all that was the extremely polite, courteous and professional staff. They were very accomodating and willing to go the extra yard to help with difficult demands of some customers.
When we were landing in CDG, we both were already looking forward to our return flight on Air France to Toronto.

My opinion: A definitely great Airline to Fly. We highly recommend it.","2018-11-20"
"5","Excellent business class experience","Air France offers an excellent business class experience. This aircraft was a 777-300 and had an outstanind business class layout. The “pods” were well designed with ample secure storage. The service was excellent and the food was very good. I suppose the movie selection could have been better for English speakers, I suppose the fact that the airline is French, they by necessity had to have a large selection of French language films. Excellent in flight map application that provide a great virtual view of the flight from many angles. Highly recommended! We will be using them for our next booking which requires a connection in Europe.","2018-11-20"
"2","Terrible check-in at Marco Polo airport.","Lack of organization for check in.  Very chaotic one and one half hour in line to check in.  The gate situation was even more chaotic.","2018-11-20"
"4","Flying back from Paris, Air France was a better experience than Delta","We flew to Paris on Delta and returned on Air France. Both economy but we had two different experiences. The flight back our seats were way back, the two seaters with extra room on the aisle. We found we had more leg room on this plane. The flight attendants were very nice and attentive. The food was excellent in comparison to what we were served on the Delta flight. The only negative was that we had to pay an extra fee to get. An assigned seat. All in all it was a pretty good experience.","2018-11-20"
"3","Air France ""24 hour rule"" for refunds","I learned a great lesson today about Air France that I want to share. I booked a flight last night on the Air France website for June 2019 from Paris to Biarritz (small city in France). I assumed the ""24 hour rule"" for a full refund would apply because I saw it when I researched online. Well, within 24 hours of the booking, I found a fast train from Paris to my destination city which would save me both time and money. I emailed Air France per their website directive regarding ""purchases made within 24 hours,"" but I had a funny feeling I should also call to ask about the refund under the ""24 hour rule."" I was told the only thing I could change was my flight to another day/time (or whatever) and there is no 100 % refund opportunity under purchases made within 24 hours. They can refund the airport tax which is minimal. Maybe it is possible to get a refund under the ""24 hour rule"" if you book an Air France flight from the USA to Paris or something like that, but there is no 100% refund for a domestic flight within 24 hours of purchase unless you purchased a refundable ticket (I didn't). Therefore, I am keeping my flight because it's silly to throw away good money, but I learned a valuable lesson for the future. My online research suggests I am entitled to a full refund as long as it's requested within 24 hours of my purchase, and that is simply not the case for a domestic flight. For this review, I have to pick a past flight date in order to post, but my flight is actually in June of 2019. It's still a good airline to fly with and they have really nice customer service - just keep in mind the 24 hour refund rule doesn't apply for domestic flights that aren't ticketed as refundable!","2018-11-20"
"3","Codeshare with Flybe with normal issues","Normal issues with too many people trying to get as much carry on bags as possible. One person checking boarding cards and bags at the gate. Slows everything down and most airports get your checked bag to the carousels easily within 20 minutes of you getting there","2018-11-20"
"3","Confused boarding and delayed","Delayed by an hour departing and arrive 30 minutes late. Confusion on boarding as we all walked back up the gangway as wrong plane, only to discover it was the right plane!!!
Staff were good along with a basic snack and drinks service","2018-11-20"
"5","Budget Airlines forget them. Go Air France.","After spending hours looking for budget flights to fit in with our travel arrangements we eventually gave up and decided to look at a scheduled flight which we realised would be more costly. Well what a pleasent surprise, not only did our fight work out cheaper, we had an in flight snack, no restriction on luggage and more importantly lots more flights to choose from. Need I say our next flight to the UK will be Air France. We also found booking with the airline direct online was considerably cheaper than various other search engines.","2018-11-20"
"4","Great all round flight","Good flight with a snack and drinks served. Comfortable ontime 2 hourflight which was good as I only had a 50  minute transfer including terminal change. Friendly and helpful staff","2018-11-20"
"3","Okay Easyjet codeshare on time","Short transfer so boarded last minute but flight departed and arrive on time. Flight was not full and normal paid for snacks. Stewardess was rude to everyone including Air France ground staff","2018-11-20"
"1","Missed my connection and lost my baggage.","Delayed on take-off from Barcelona is understandable, but the incompetence and unhelpfulness of the staff in Paris - Charle De Gaulle (CDG) is hard to fathom. 
We were initially sent to the wrong gate for our connecting flight, then had to go through security again. As we had arrived late our connecting flight (also Air France) had left and there was no-one at the Gate to assist us. (We had spoken to multiple Air France personnel but it seems that no-one had called the Gate to tell them our flight had been delayed and we were on our way.)
It took us an hour to speak to some-one at a customer service desk (she was very nice once we got to her) and there were no more direct flights that day. 
We took a connecting flight via Heathrow and got home 7 hours later than scheduled, but that was not the end of the story.
Even though we had to pay for our bags a second time, they did not arrive at our destination. In fact it turned out they had never left CDG, but we filed a ""missing baggage"" claim and were told to expect them the next day.
The following day we arrived at our local airport and were told that the bags had NOT been put on the plane in CDG, but they would be sent on the next day.
A little warier, we called the airport the next day and were told that once again our baggage had NOT been put on the plane in CDG and it was expected to arrive the following day.
Finally, 3 days after our arrival home, we got our luggage, quite dirty and battered.
All in all the worst flight experience I have ever had, and would NEVER fly with this Airline again.","2018-11-20"
"4","Flight home","After having not such a good flight out with Air Mauritius, was really pleased we came home with Air France, Everything was very smooth and no issues apart from the fact the plane was so cold, people sitting with coats on and extra blankets, the crew were asked but nothing done. This stopped me giving this a 5 star rating.
Nice touch from the crew when they went for their break they left trollies with water, soft drinks and snacks to help yourself-nice one.
On the whole apart from being cold a really good flight home.","2018-11-20"
"1","Sloppy and disorganized baggage handling leads to unnecessary delays.","While my connecting flight from Cork arrived on-time, take-off from Paris was delayed by over an hour because ""too many people had carry-on bags"".
It is shocking that a professional airline cannot be sufficiently organized to handle this during check-in or boarding instead of spending an hour re-organizing after boarding.","2018-11-20"
"1","Incredibly Rude Check-in Experience","After flying with Air France for many years, I encountered the rudest woman in airline history who treated me so disrespectfully in spite of the fact that I was in the first class checkin line and am an elite Flying Blue member. I asked for her name to report her and she refused to give it to me (no name tags either). It absolutely ruined the trip.","2018-11-19"
"3","Good flight","This was a good flight, it left on time and the staff were efficient. There was a bit of a scramble with cabin luggage, as some passengers had put theri small bags and coats up in the overhead bins, which should have been under the seat in front, but the crew sorted everything out in good time for take off. Given the cost of the flight, you would expect a hot drink or a snack, but you have to purchase everything on this flight, which lets them down compared to similar flights with other airlines. Overall, the service was good.","2018-11-19"
"4","Offwe go to Disneyland","Good flight from Edinburgh,plenty of space ,unfortunately our hand luggage was put in the hold so we were longer at the airport.We were given a snack on board which was good","2018-11-08"
"5","Very efficient","The plane was 3 seats and 3 seats across. The flight was very quick around an hour. The flight attendants were available to help if needed. After take off they served drinks and a cookie. The flight was smooth. We had to walk along the tarmac to board from the back of the plane.","2018-11-08"
"4","Depends on the plane / read review","This is a review on two flights I took. 

Miami to Paris on a regular plane, barely a 3 star rating for me. it was uncomfortable, food was horrible and lots of turbulence. Thin cushion on seats. Felt like I was sitting on wooden chair. 

On the other hand, Flight from Paris to Miami was very nice, I think the difference was the A380 airbus that we went on. Very spacious, not cramped, comfortable ride. Seat was a bit worn out, could use a refresh on seats and entertainment system. But overall a way better experience than going to paris. 

Both restrooms were clean and worked well. And we didn't have any issues with entertainment system.","2018-11-08"
"1","Might as Well Talk To Myself","My flight was not a long one, not a hard one. Two 3 hour segments with 3 hour layovers in Paris. 

I ordered a wheelchair as I have crushed discs and nerve damage so that I can walk about 200 to 400 feet (0.12 km) before both legs give out. 

No chair showed up although it was shown on my boarding pass. I asked, and they said it will take a long time. So I walked and sat and walked and sat my way through the airport, thank goodness for the 3-hour layover. 

I wrote customer service, and they apologized and asked for my flight number for the way back. I gave it to them and again it was on my boarding pass...again no wheelchair until I demanded, yet still I waited over 45 minutes at the gate.

I am a combat veteran, 100% disabled and a bad case of PTSD, yet I held back and waited. I was passed from one station to another where no one gave a damn. After 2 hours I got to my gate...two hours. 

My message to the customer service was blown off, first they said sorry, I wrote, this is not acceptable, then they said it is not their responsibility, then stated the flight was not booked direct so it is not their responsibility, then they said again it was not their responsibility.

This is Air France. This is the new level of customer service. 
Good luck if you fly with them.","2018-11-08"
"4","Easy and comfort","Nice trip and very kind flight attendant. Pleased to be located next to the window and be in a plane with only two seat per row. maybe the middle snack, aubergine and something else, not the best choice...
Good space for legroom","2018-11-08"
"1","Air France reduced me to tears and has TERRIBLE customer service","Air France lost our luggage and we had to stay in our travel clothes for over 24 hours on the first leg of our honeymoon. In order to get our baggage delivered to us we also had to forfeit a night at a luxury hotel, postpone our drive across Croatia, and stay an extra night in Zagreb. We could only afford to book two nights at the hotel we weren't able to drive to in the first place and had to settle for a mediocre spot in Zagreb :( Really disappointing and crushing - I was reduced to tears. We have emailed and called FIVE TIMES and Air France has yet to provide us with any compensation for the hassle and inconvenience. We had to go dinner the first night of my honeymoon in the same clothes we'd been travelling in for 16 hours and they haven't even issued an apology. I've asked for someone - ANYONE to call me back and I haven't had a single call.","2018-11-08"
"2","C'est dommage monsieur!","With a Gallic shrug and a lofty je ne sais pas, the check-in staff of Air France retired the trophy for most arrogant, least interested and annoying so-called customer care agents.
At issue was my inability to apply the discount for pre-paying baggage fees on the AF website. Did they care? Non!! Could they be reasoned with? Non, non!!
I say to you, Air France: Encore? Non!!","2018-11-08"
"2","Poor service","This was a 10 hour flight during the daytime.  The attendants came by shortly after takeoff with the beverage cart, followed by lunch/dinner shortly thereafter.  In the next 5 hours one attendant walked quickly by with an offer of water.  Shortly before descendent, we were served a boxed snack with a choice of soft drinks.  I have never been on a long international flight with little attention from the flight attendants.  It would have been nice to have been offered a cocktail during the 5 hour interval.  Water was available but only if you walked to the back of the plane to get it.","2018-11-08"
"2","Cramped","Not much leg room, stiff seats, and no sideroom. This was for a 9hr flight. Overall service good but not for comfort.","2018-11-07"
"4","Air France Paris to Rome","A no frills flight in economy class.  More room than normal in seats, I was pleasantly surprised by the leg room. Everything on time, no complaints.","2018-11-07"
"4","Confusion with Delta","We purchased our tickets 6 months before traveling.  We prepaid for our baggage since we were going to be away for 13 days'.  When we went to check in on line we were asked to pay $65 per bag.  I selected no bags (since prepaid).  When we arrived at Logan, the Delta ticket agent said they had no record of the Air France transaction.  I had confirmation on my phone/email, but they still wanted to charge us $75 per bag since we did not pay on line the day before.  Finally a supervisor was able to retrieve original ticket reservation and put our bags on as agreed to 6 months earlier.  Ironically the same disconnect occurred on our way back from Paris and when discussing the original purchase as we did above it took so long we almost missed our flight.

Once we were seated the service was wonderful.  It was quite amazing that with todays technology Air France and Delta do not have the ability to look at each others data base.  Their only solution was to charge the fee and have us fight about it after the fact.","2018-11-07"
"5","All food drinks and service included!","Best airline I’ve been on in a while!  The service was great while checking in and service on the plane.  Everything was included on the flight including alcoholic beverages.  The seats were good and entertainment was excellent.  Wish more airline were like them.","2018-11-07"
"5","Food and service excellent","Food and staff were great, too bad we had to fly out of CdeG airport. The games and entertainment were not as good as KLM, but were ok nad kept us occupied.","2018-11-07"
"5","If you are into good food, their business class is a great option!","Champagne, foie gras, good food(you can choose your menu on-line before your flight if you want to), very good service and a comfortable chair/bed/entertainment center. It was indeed the best option for this kind of long flight (about 12 hours). i would fly with Air France back to Latin America with no hesitation!","2018-11-07"
"3","Air France Pilots Fly Differently to Other Airlines","I have flown Air France on many occasions and find that the pilots fly their planes in a different way to other airlines. This flight was short and there was a fair amount of turbulence which didn't help but when they start the decent it always seems far to steep in a short space of time and less gradual than other airlines as well as the landings being very hard. I also felt the plane was off target a bit for the runway as there was quite an abrupt turn to correct the flight path, could have been my imagination but it didn't feel right. The amount of times i have flown you get to know how planes are flown and which airlines are good or bad etc.I thought I was flying Flybe on booking but they code share so be careful if you think you're flying one airline and end up on another.","2018-11-07"
"2","Would not recommend","I had the pleasure to fly American Airlines as well to Europe as well as Air France, given the choice pick American","2018-11-07"
"4","All good and on time","We used this flight as last part of our journey. When we made our tight Connection, they already started Boarding. The Boarding agents were friendly. The plane had plenty of bins for the bags, which is with other airlines sometimes a bit of a problem. We departed on time and arrived 10 min early in Zürich. The cabin crew were friendly and smiling, which we weren't used to from Air France due to previous experience. We received a drink and a Sandwich - vegetarian, which was actually nice. Happy to fly again with AF","2018-11-07"
"4","The most comfortable flight","AF 291 (KIX, Osaka - CDG, Paris) became the flight cancellation by great damage of Kansai Airport by 21st typhoon on September 19, 2018. Therefore, we went to Paris by AF293 (Haneda, Tokyo - CDG, Paris) on the same day. It was a really midnight flight, and all services such as meal and wine were modest. The return flight satisfied us in AF292 (CDG - KIX). We had a Japanese crew and she was smart, and her service and correspondence were very warm and humorous. We were relaxed, and able to enjoy the plane. I took Air France flights between Japan and Paris so many times. There was not a service comfortable so much. It was the most comfortable flight.","2018-11-06"
"5","an old time classic airline that follows the future","i thought that Air France would have stayed in the past, leaving the gulf companies lied. No! Air France is following the progress of the future, by keeping the class of an old, stable and experienced airline. the staff is very experienced, the aircraft was brand new and the seat was more comfortable than i expected. the in flight entertainment had a variety of movies and the screens were very new! i also would like to add that the windows in 787-900 have an automated way to keep the light away but you may look outside at the same time. very innovated idea of Boeing! i would appreciate a small purse with shocks, toothpaste and hand cream, due to the length of the flight.","2018-11-06"
"4","Always Late","Great deal compared to other price airlines. Crew and Flight attendants were very nice.
Build extra connection time into your travel as this airline is always late. San. Francisco is a horrible place for connecting travellers. Understaffed Immigration and no representative in sight? You have a problem ........its all yours! I ran to my next departure area only to find one of 3 X-ray machines operating? No one cares if you make your flight .....or not.
Airport staff have a poor attitude.....if you can find them. Avoid this airport if you can, is my best suggestion. Guess if i lived in SFO i would also have attitude....","2018-11-06"
"5","Transatlantic Premium Economy AF vs KLM","This fall I travelled, with friends, to Budapest and back from Prague for a Danube River Cruise. The choice of airlines was ours. Not being familiar with KLM or Air France we chose one outbound and the other return. Two out of four of us travelled Economy, the other two Premium Economy on the same flights. A comparison of the service on KLM after our landing in Amsterdam revealed that there was no discernible  difference  between the two classes other than priority check-in (but not boarding). Our seats were 3 rows apart and there was a meaningless partition.  There wasn’t a nearby washroom. I didn’t need the extra baggage allowance and am short so the legroom wasn’t an issue. The onboard service was efficient but there was no difference in service or amenities between the two cabins that we could discern after a post flight comparison. My point is that there was no value for the extra charge for Premium Economy. 
Luckily, the best was saved for last!  There was a dedicated cabin crew on Air France. The aircraft configuration allowed for a nearby washroom which matters to me. The welcome was warm, the service was impeccable and sincere. It seemed the flight attendants, more men than women in this case, (and allow me to state that we are women in our mid sixties, now lamented as being almost invisible to service providers) treated their duties as a vocation rather than a job. 
From the amenity bag to the multi-course meal and frequent inquiries about our well-being throughout the flight I feel the contrast between the two transatlantic carriers merit a comparison and glowing review for AIr France!","2018-10-27"
"5","Pleasant  flight","Had a nice flight, smooth & on time, although both flights were short, snacks were given on both, cabin crew helpful & friendly, no inflight entertainment but didnt make a difference, i would travel with air France again","2018-10-27"
"5","If they abandon the the ADN of Strike it could become a good company.","Since a few month the quality of the service is great and the attitude of the personal has really changed for the good. I must say that if the pilots stop their stupid attitudes of spoiled childs I will fly Air France again. Having been a Club 2000 for 30 years and now platinum life I have a good recognition for the personel which was not the case before. I do not know who is responsible for the change of attitude of the personel but congratulations . They will just have to replace most of their pilots for a despicable attitude which for years made me use other companies.","2018-10-26"
"3","Minimal Space in Economy","The flight attendants and service was good.  The price for this flight was also very good.  The food was a bit better than other airlines and having complimentary wine was enjoyed by many. The entertainment selection are decent. Being able to watch the flight information and the camera as we were overland was interesting.  However the seats in economy are very close together and if you are ta tall person, very uncomfortable.  You pay extra to assure that you will sit with your party, although the ground people make a great effort to get you together when you check in.  We were also unable to check in until we got to the airport when leaving from the US.  Changing planes in Paris was very confusing and the directions to the connecting flight was inaccurate,   The signage in Paris was also very poor, particularly as it was directing us around construction.   .","2018-10-26"
"5","Comfort ","A380 - 800 is the way to fly.  It's comfortable, quiet and service is impeccable. There was a big difference in cabin noise (air plugs needed) on the return trip aboard the A330 - 300 jet. You can afford it be sure it's on your booking.","2018-10-26"
"1","What a disappointing service AF","I flew light to Italy for 2 weeks. On our way back home we were treated awful. Our carryon bag was weighed and we were asked to take things out of the bag until we basically were left with the bag and a couple clothing items inside- this what was allowed. In addition we were asked to check in and pay 50 euro per bag. Reservation did not highlight this fee- all it said was that fees might apply. We were flying internationally from Florence to San Francisco with a stop in Paris. I never had to pay for 1st bag when flying internationally with a FULL service airline. On the flight we saw people with much larger bags and suitcases. Bag was the size of a carryon. And if this was not enough they separated my husband and I seats- 2 middle seats at the end of the plane not together for 2 + 11 hour flights. No one to talk with... what a lousy end to a beautiful vacation- “thank you” AirFrance for a terrible experience. Tried to contact AirFrance after my trip with no luck. Sent an email with no response so far. ( 10 days ago).","2018-10-26"
"3","Not idle, but serviceable","As a Delta frequent flyer, I choose to fly Air France when abroad when Delta or KLM is not an option ( these are Delta partners). Air France is frequently not on time, making my connections difficult. The staff are okay, but usually indifferent to my frustration when the flights are late. I also find the planes to be outdated, which isn’t a huge concern, but it is annoying on an overseas flight to find there is no phone charger.

Overall, I’ll fly Air France if there’s no other comparable option in price, but I won’t be thrilled.","2018-10-26"
"4","flight home from Italy trip with CDG stopover","good food, comfortable in a 380. Easy to walk around for exercise during the long flight .
Easy onboarding.","2018-10-26"
"4","Unexpected upgrade made for a great overnight flight","As a Delta Platinum status holder, I was able to reserve the best seats in Economy as complimentary so I was sitting in the first row of Economy class.  As I went to board the plane, the scanner beeped--which is usually not a good sign.  However, in this case, AF had upgraded me (presumably because of my Delta status) to Premium Economy so I moved 1 row forward, past the bulkhead, still the right hand window seat which I preferred for a long-haul overnight flight.  All this made for a very pleasant flight.","2018-10-26"
"5","Excellent Flight","Enjoyed this flight.  We fly a lot and found this flight to be very good.  Seats seemed to be more comfortable and spacious than usual.  Clean, newer plane and ontime.  Plenty of entertainment choices.  Short layover in Paris that condensed overall time to destination.","2018-10-26"
"5","Business Class (Air France)","First time flying Air France and I was pleasantly surprised.  I enjoyed the use of the Lounge and check-in was pretty smooth.  The cabin and seat were comfortable and the service was really nice.  I would definitely fly Air France Business class again.  The only semi disappointing this was the AF Business class Lounge at FCO on the return flight is","2018-10-26"

"2","Flight was great but the service at the airport was non existent.","We left Nice and they were so attentive. Our flight from Paris to Lax was great.  The only drawback was getting from one terminal to another for the change of planes. No complaints re: the flight but upon landing to change planes there was no one to guide you as to where to go and where you are to go.
An hour and a half later of buses, trains and walking we made it to our terminal. Did I mention that the wheelchair that was to meet my husband was not there?","2018-10-25"
"3","Flight direct from Vancouver to Paris","Non stop flight,which was nice,but the food was not very good.
For an international flight,you do not expect top class food,especially in Cargo class,but it fell below  our already  low expectations.
The return flight with Delta was far,far better.","2018-10-25"
"3","Long flight with tight seating "," Very long flight about 10 hours. Seating is tight, unable to recline seat.  Width of seat, very small. Uncomfortable!!!!  My kneecap was touching the seat in front of me, I’m only 5-9. Bathrooms dirty and small, not enough of them with 100’s of folks.","2018-10-25"
"5","Comfort with Lovely Service","My wife and I tried the “Premium Economy” class with Air France and it was wonderful.  Seats were way more comfortable than normal economy plus the extra legroom was sooo nice on a long flight. Flight attendants were friendly and nice. The wine was and food were both good. It almost sounds like an oxymoron, but we had an excellent flying experience and an overall good value","2018-10-25"
"4","Great service","Comfortable flight with great service. The app is a must , it makes everything so easy. Good breakfast for such a short flight . Cabin crew were very attentive . Check in is really smooth . Prices better than expected .","2018-10-25"
"3","Suitcase was broken and seats uncomfortable","After a two hour delay, and with no information with the exception of reading the flight board. We finally were able to board our flight. We had chosen economy simply because it was only going to be a short 55 minute flight. The seats were uncomfortable and if I didn't know the people sitting next to me I would have been even more uncomfortable. I do however travel primarily in business class so perhaps I am spoiled. I would have given Air France a 1 but the flight staff was amazing and made us all as comfortable as could be. I think next time I will hire a driver and make 10 Hour trip over two days.

Will I travel Air France again.probably but in business premium or first class","2018-10-25"
"3","Almost missed the connecting flight","On our outward flight we had 4hrs 50 mins to transfer from Charles de Gaulle to Orly airport in Paris.  This was plenty of time, taking the transfer bus service and having a drink at Orly. On the return flight we had only 3hrs 35 mins.  The flight from Lourdes was delayed 40mins and landing at Orly it took them 20 mins to supply the steps to leave the plane. We then had to hurriedly get a taxi, arriving at Charles de Gaulle at 2.50 for an embarkation at 3.25. We ended up running to the departure gate!","2018-10-25"
"5","The best","Check in and boarding, very smooth and amazingly organized. The on board service was excellent. The crew did not disappeared for hours unlike our previous experiences with other airlines.","2018-10-25"

I cant even begin to describe the terrible stench from the row behind me. the family had two children who were both sick, both talking well above normal decibals while the mother sat and did nothing.. that father...he didnt do anything about the children but boy did he produce volumes of LOUD rumbling gas that smelled awful.","2018-10-15"
"3","Meh!","Booked Air France with my wife for her business trip with a little fun added in for the both of us. Booking was fine as was checking in at ORD. I have flown AF before but it was a few years ago. We took advantage of the AF Lounge at ORD and thought it was average at best. Once on board the plane we found it to be drab, dirty and very old looking. Food selections were decent and the entertainment selections were lacking to say the least. When we arrived in Paris we were all set to disembark and the aircrew had my wife and I wait “until the business and first class were off”. I politely reminded her that we were in business class (she was the same one serving us for the last 8 hours) and we ended up missing the first bus back. Oh yes the bus. Just like last time I flew AF to Paris you park out on the property and get bussed to the terminal so be aware that you have another 30+ minutes added after you land to get to the terminal so if you have a close connection forget it.","2018-10-14"
"5","Best Flight to Europe","A great way to start your trip to Europe, and arrive to Paris.  Excellent service with all the little touches to make this overnight flight as pleasant as a red eye flight can be.  Considering that it was a full flight, boarding was well done, Once off, flight attendant passed with warm towels, an aperitif and crusty baguette rolls, the food that followed was excellent and they offered a wonderful choice of wines to accompany, ending with desert and for those who wish a light digestif.  On board entertainment included International and French films, and a good music selection to make the flight as pleasant as possible.  They also provided passengers with a pillow, blanket and a small pouch that included eye cover, a toothbrush and small toothpaste which was really handy in the morning.   Though sleep was as best it can be on a flight, the morning started with coffee and a nice light breakfast which made the rest more pleasant on arrival.   Best flight experience to Europe.","2018-10-14"
"5","Way Better Than We Expected","Much better experience than we expected.  The staff was exceptional, courteous and frequently checked in to see if we needed anything.  The in-flight food was probably the best we ever had; offering multiple choice of hot meals...not just peanuts and complimentary soda or water.  Even the in-flight entertainment was solid.  Great service...","2018-10-14"
"5","Efficient carrier","Convenient flight schedule from Paris to BARCELONA, professional staff at the flight counter facilitating the check-in process. New fleet of carriers with very comfortable seats. Highly recommended for frequent passengers on this route","2018-10-14"
"1","Cancelled flight with no reason","Our 16h50 flight was cancelled as we arrived at the airport and we were on our way to Barcelona. No reason on why the flight was cancelled, we were offered accommodation and a flight the following day but we had hotel bookings and airport transfer at Barcelona. We were eventually booked on a later flight, 4 hours later and offered only an 11 euro for our inconvenience. The later flight was suppose to leave at 21h10 but was delayed to 21h40 and only left at 22h15 as we arrive in Barcelona before midnight. We had to rebook and pay extra for our airport transfer but Air France but was not interested in our arrangements. We only arrived at our hotel before 1am as we had to arrive initially at 7pm.

Air France is really a disaster and not worried about its passengers as it has the attitude that the customer needs them as not they the customer.","2018-10-14"
"3","Not bad but not great","As most of us know, airline travel in general is not great these days. Crowded flights, limited service, rude passengers, apathetic flight crews.........all contribute to less than wonderful travel experiences. 

However, our flight from Paris to Atlanta was a Boeing 777 and it was huge. Not sure how many passengers but it was over 300, perhaps close to 400. In spite of that the crew did a decent job of servicing the chock full plane. The flight departed late but we made up some time and arrived 20 minutes early in Atlanta. Kudos to the pilot. 

Food service was okay but traveling in economy is disappointing after flying Business Class on most flights. The luggage arrived in a timely way after we passed through customs so no complaints there. 

Overall a decent experience with Air France. Been a while since I have flown with them but I will do so again if their rates are competitive.","2018-10-14"
"4","Meant business","Have a neat cabin with courteous staff. Greeted with champagne and cheese. Good flat beds and most impressive was a small cupboard to keep certain small things and enjoy ypur sleep. The TV screen is less flexible and you have to adjust accordingly. ","2018-10-14"
"4","Smooth ride; save your appetite!","I flew an A380 Airbus which offered an exceptionally smooth ride but took a long time to load as it seats 500 people. As I am  lactose intolerant I ordered an ""Asian dairy-free"" meal which was not good enough to eat. Other economy class meals seemed equally bad, so I advise that you special order your  dinner. I paid extra  for a seat with no seat in front of it. I received this premium option on the flight over, but not on the flight back. I will have to argue with the airline.","2018-10-14"
"5","Great flight and good service","Great flight from LAX to Charles de Gaulle.  A380 is the Cadillac of planes.  Transferred to JOON Air to Lisbon. Seamless .  My advice book at least 2 hours for connecting on Paris.","2018-10-14"
"5","Good airline,. On time departures, and good food.","The food is good,  the wine is free and the air hosts and hostesses are happy to serve you and make you feel welcome. Unlike many north american airlines that serve lousy food, and hostessesvare primarily for your safety, which when translated means thatveven though they work in the service industry, they dislike serving you.  The price was also nice!","2018-10-14"
"2","Delays & lost baggage","I received an email from Tripadvisor asking me to review a recent flight. Apologies as it is not a short story. Before my most recent flight I want to take you back to July 2017 when I flew with Air France from Birmingham via Paris to Johannesburg. I should point out that my final destination was Durban, but Air France could not take a flight booking on line for Durban. My wife and I have flown several times on this route and we even joined the Flying Blue scheme to gain air miles with Air France. My wife though decided a couple of years she would use a different airline, and this so far has been a good choice.
I arrived early at Birmingham International and the check in desk was still open for an earlier flight to Paris. Bonus as this meant not having to sit with my bag for two hours without being able to get through passport control. As soon as I got through security I read that my flight had been delayed. After an hour I tracked down a lady to ask what the situation was. Not easy finding anyone as there is no actual help desk. The connection flight times are very tight, so I was already worried that I would miss the overnight flight from Paris to Johannesburg. The lady took me to a telephone where I spoke to a man who advised me there was no other way of getting me to Paris or Johannesburg from Birmingham. He also told me not to worry as I would be looked after in Paris. 
The inevitable happened and the delayed flight meant I missed my connection in Paris. Frustratingly I could not have missed it by much, but I had missed it. I was told to make my way to the Air France help desk where I would be told the plan of action for me. I do not speak French so the directions I was given meant I got lost and it seemed to take me an age to find the desk. When I got there it was chaos. Many people had missed their connecting flights to worldwide destinations including the far east and South America. The reality was there was no way of getting me to Johannesburg that night and now it was around midnight. I was getting ‘hangry’ a mix of hungry & tiredness. My goody bag sadly contained no food and I was not offered any. Other people were given food, but not me. The plan now was to catch a daytime flight with KLM, an Air France partner, from Amsterdam the following morning.  From the airport I was to be picked up by a bus and taken to a hotel. There were so many people waiting for busses that after an hour I asked if I could sleep in the airport. I was told no. Eventually around 3am I got to my hotel which meant I had two hours before I had to be up to catch another bus back to the airport. Again, I queued with other disgruntled delayed passengers awaiting my room allocation. Hooray a room key at last. Making my way up two or three floors I could not find my room. Back to the hotel reception and another queue. When I reached the front, a smug attendant laughed at me and told me he would take me to my room. To his amazement there was no room with the number I had been allocated! This had truly been a long day! After less than two hours sleep I was back on a bus, a bus that ran ahead of time that I was lucky to catch. If I remember correctly I had a voucher for €15.00 for breakfast to be spent at the airport before I flew to Amsterdam. My first food for over twelve hours! 
My problems though were far from over. Because my flight was to Johannesburg, that was the destination that Air France would get me to. I had booked an internal flight to Durban with another airline that I had also missed. It was not the responsibility of Air France to get me to Durban or reimburse me my lost air fare. My brother-in-law had also arranged his working day so that he could collect me from Durban. I was due to arrive there at around 2pm. I was now going to arrive at Johannesburg around 10pm. He made a plan, picked up a friend to share the driving and drove from Durban to Johannesburg. A mere seven-hour journey there and then five more hours back to his house. 
To finish my travels off my baggage was lost. I was called the following day and was told that it would not be delivered until the next day which was a Friday. I was then called to be told that there was no one available to deliver my bag. After a heated discussion the company did agree they would deliver but not to where I was staying as it was farm and they did not deliver to farms. I met the driver with my bag in total darkness at a service station which was closed for the night. 
I received from Air France as compensation a voucher valued at just over £700.00. The reason for my delay was adverse weather, or so we were told at the time. As it turned out, and I was told this twelve months later, the delays were caused by staff shortages.  I used this voucher to book my most recent flight using the same route as before. I had to book via telephone as the voucher could not be used on line. I wanted to book all the way to Durban but was told again that this was not an option. So, I again booked an internal flight with another airline. To my amazement on this flight flying partners from other airlines were welcomed on board. These included Air France. Phew, no delays and all went smoothly. That was until I went to collect my luggage. For the second year running my bag was lost. Not to worry I was told at the information desk, it would be here tomorrow. And I was told that could spend up to €100.00 on essentials, personal hygiene, clothing, etc. It was now Thursday so one night without anything would be ok. However, I had a business meeting on the Friday morning so opted to spend on a few things. I called to chase my bags on the Friday but was told they had not arrived. On the Saturday I was moving inland for the weekend. I called the baggage people again on the Saturday and had to change the delivery address for my bag on line. I called several times over the weekend and on the Sunday was told my bag was now in Johannesburg. I was asked where my nearest airport was, and I told them it was Pietermariztburg. I then heard nothing and when I did speak to someone they said they could not help me as they were just covering a shift. I should add that from day one I had been asking Air France for their help through instant messaging on Facebook, so they were fully aware of my situation. At 2pm on the Sunday afternoon I called Pietermariztburg airport to see if they had received my bag. I was told that all staff at the airport were South African Airlines employees, so they could not help me. The lady I spoke to was helpful and called me around 2.30pm to say she had my bag. She also told me there was no way a courier would bring it on a Sunday to me. I jumped in my hire car to collect the bag. The lady then called me to say that a courier had turned up and would deliver my bag. I spoke to him and he said he would see me soon and we would meet at a hotel not far from where I was staying. The airport is around an hour and a half away so at 5pm I drove to the hotel. I went into the hotel and told the staff my situation. I waited an hour then drove back to where I was staying. I called the airport again, but no one had the courier’s number. In total darkness again my bag was delivered to the farm. The courier had been to the hotel and they kindly guided him to where I was staying. The next morning at first light I left the farm to start my travels again. When I arrived at my first destination I noticed my bag was damaged. It had clearly been thrown so hard that one of the wheels had split through the outer material leaving a large hole. I was now off grid though, no internet reception, and would be another week. The main reason for my trip to South Africa this time was to take part in a five-day primitive trail in the Imfolozi Wilderness area. No phones allowed here! I notified Air France through Facebook at the earliest opportunity and was told I had only seven days from the date on arrival in South Africa to make any claims. I made a claim on my return to the UK for the money I had spent on clothing and toiletries, plus my bag which can no longer be used. I also mentioned that my phone bill was big as I had to keep calling the baggage people as they did not seem to want to call me. This is there answer: 
I have to inform you that, according to the Montreal Convention, claims for delayed baggage must be submitted to the airline within 21 days after you received your baggage and claims for damaged baggage must be submitted to the airline within 7 days after you received your baggage. For this reason I’m afraid we can’t offer you compensation in this case
I have asked them again to show some common sense with my claim, but I have not heard back from them.","2018-10-14"
"4","AF Premium Economy","Air France's premium economy is amazing!  I have flown premium economy on British Airways and found Air France to be superior.  The seats are very comfortable. The food choices were very good. You get a comfort pack which contains covers for the headphones (which are noise canceling, a plus when there is a baby having a meltdown), toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, earplugs and eye mask. The bag it comes in is very nice and plan to use it for other things.

The one drawback is the toilet was in economy and one had to walk about 20 rows to get there. While business class was just ahead of us, but we were not permitted to use those (closer toilets).

As usual on European airlines, flight attendants bring water around during the flight, however the cabin lights are off and by the time you realize what is going on, the flight attendant has passed your row.","2018-10-13"
"3","Premium economy air france","After flying business class for 14 years thanks to our daughter’s Delta employment and redeeming delta sky miles, this trip we had to settle for paid premium economy and ended up on Air France.  It was impossible to make reservations online and my phone reservations were very unsettling.  With 180,000 miles I had hoped to upgrade to business class but it doesn’t work that way anymore.  I had even gotten the promotional Delta Amex gold 60,000 bonus miles only to learn they were useless for this trip. Atlanta Paris was an older plane.   No WiFi and seats so-so as far as comfort.  A long flight not to have latest amenities.  Thankfully we did not land on the tarmac with bussing to the terminal as had been the case with Delta flights the past 15 years.  Joon airline from Paris to Cairo was so much better in every way.  New planes, comfortable seats and a pleasant 4 1/2 hour trip.  We return tomorrow and we are in Economy seats to Paris.  Numerous calls while in the states to Air France and delta were useless and no one had a reason for the downgrade.  Short of going to Air France office here in Cairo, no way to get answers by phone.  Air France in Paris airport said they could not help us with return seat assignments.  Husband and I are 80 and we both have mobility limitations so being scrunched into an economy seat is of concern.  We are assuming return Paris/Atlanta flight will be same as outbound.  It will be nice to be back on delta in the US to complete our trip in Delta Comfort.  Traveling with disabilities in the Paris airport we found the lack of handicapped restrooms troublesome.  My bottom line on this trip...international travel is best left to the young and able passenger.","2018-10-13"

"3","Need to take lessons from Asian airlines","I travelled business on its 777-300ER jet.  This was my first time on Air France and was eager to experience it as I usually prefer to fly with Asian or Middle Eastern airlines.  I found their service very nonchalant - they don't even bother to address you by name.  I ordered a special meal and it was not even served, asked for it, they had no clue.  The crew's service level was pretty much on-demand, they don't offer anything unless you ask.  The food served was very underwhelming with the exception of the mash potatoes that came with the overcooked steak on my trip from HK-Paris.  Selection of movies is not exhaustive more French content than English.  The only upside was the seat, spacious with a lot of compartments to store your items.

I must say the lounge in CDG Terminal 2E was probably the worst i've been to.  The toilets are so dirty (toilets in the terminal are cleaner), they don't bother replacing the toilet rolls.  Was going to take a shower but was told they were out of hot water...  I wouldn't have taken my shower there anyways, because the shower rooms looks unhygienic like its toilets and its communal.  

Also, what's the point of of having an express lane for business class passengers when there was only 1 immigration counter and 2 lanes for baggage scanning.  This resulted in a long wait to clear both immigration & scanning.  

Asian airlines all the way for me from hereon!","2018-10-13"
"5","Flying as it once was","The two flights featured abundant leg room. It was even possible to cross your legs. Flight attendants were helpful, individual screens worked and the meals were very good. Champagne beer and wine were offered,even cognac. Highly recommend","2018-10-13"

"5","AMAZING","Flying economy with Air France was a more enjoyable flight then flying Plus with Westjet. The seats were roomy, your elbows were not crammed up against the window. The inflight entertainment had lots of options. They fed us 2 full meals, provided free booze with your dinner. Any time you asked for an additional refreshment a full can of pop was given without question. The staff were friendly and helpful. We would defiantly fly Air France in the future. We had a lovely flight experience. They also provided on each seat a blanket, face mask, ear buds and pillow.","2018-10-02"
"5","Of blue skies","I had had gotten over my fear for flights...on stepping into the plane I knew it was going to be a pleasant 7hrs flight.
The attendants were super friendly with constant smiles on their faces.
Did I mention how many times I ate in that flight by the time I was landing I was fully catered for entertainment as well had latest movies songs...take off and landing were brilliantly executed....
Until next time...","2018-10-02"
"1","Cancelled our flight 28 hors before we took off.","They cancelled our connecting flight 28 hours before we took off. We were in Orlando on a big family holiday travelling with two 76 year old family members and we received an email stating our flights were cancelled. We then received another email saying we were booked on another flight the day after we were supposed to be home. We were meant to get home on Tuesday the 18th September but our connecting flight from Paris to Aberdeen was changed to Wednesday the 19th. So we were meant to miss work, stay somehwere in Paris with two 76 year olds and my daughter who is a type one diabetic who needs to regulate her food and take insulin regularly. We ended up getting our flights changed another Airline which did get us home on the correct day but with an extra connection. This as you can imaging was very stressfull and tiring. We have had no contact from Air France regarding any of this as I think they do not care.","2018-10-02"
"1","Seats too small and they cancelled our connecting flight.","Well the seats were to narrow and the leg room too short. When the person in front of my son put his seat back my son who is only about 6' tall had his knees almost crushed.
The man then moved into the seat in front of me and I got the same I am only 5' 10"" .
When the seats are back you are only about 10"" from the TV monitor which is not good for your eyesight. We got very little in the way of drinks and about 7 hours into the flight we found out that there was a drinks cart opposite the toiletst that we could get water or juice from. It would have been very simple to explane this to us. Just not impressed with this Airline and I will endevour never to fly with them again.","2018-10-02"
"5","Excellent food and service.","Let's start with the bad thing: The legroom in Air France business class is poor even in economy class standards. If you're not seated on the first row, expect to be cramped just like all passengers on the airplane.
But, if you're seated on the first row, where we were lucky to be seated, you're going to enjoy a great flight with food, beverage and service like in a good restaurant.
Upon boarding, we were greeted by the very nice crew. A bottle of water, comfort kit, pillow and blanket were waiting for us on our seats. Before takeoff we were served with a choice of orange juice or Champagne. 
After takeoff dinner was served. Although serving trays are smaller than regular business class trays, ours was full with tasty food. Smoked salmon with blini and creme fresh for starters, shrimp in lobster sauce with wild rice, spinach and mushrooms, small cheese plate and a very good desert, all this with a glass of a good Bordeaux. 
After dinner we were offered coffee and tea, some sweets and a glass of Cognac.
What Air France lack in seat comfort, they make it up with great service. I'm looking forward to flying with them again, hopefully with the wonderful crew we had.","2018-10-02"
"2","Premium economy a big disappointment","The first leg of the trip was in a Qantas A380 and was wonderful, more like business class than premium economy. But the long haul (13.5 hours) from Singapore to Paris in an Air France 770 was no better than economy. The seat didn't recline, just slid forward a little with a bit of effort  from the flight attendant, and the footrest was so poorly aligned, it was a waste of space. The food was average and the toilet small, though they did keep it clean.","2018-10-02"
"4","Premium Economy is worth the extra cost","Let's face it -- no airline today can achieve an ""excellent"" (5 star) rating today.  Those days are long gone.

We travel between SFO and CDG annually, and Air France continues to be our first choice.  (If we couldn't use Air France we would fly their sister airline KLM to Amsterdam and then take the train or another flight down to Paris.  I'm afraid that the US carriers fall into the 1 or 2 star category.)

The cabin service was very good, as it always seems to be.  The food was passable (as airline food goes) but one cannot expect a good meal in an airplane -- it's better in Business class, and even better in First, but the cost differential is not worth it.  Best thing to do is to drink water (no alcohol), eat as little as possible, and try to sleep -- or at least rest -- in order to avoid jet-lag.

Speaking of sleeping, we've tried the AF A380 business class but those seats are really not as comfortable to us as the premium economy.  (KLM, on the other hand, flies the 747 with lay-flat seats in business class.  Those are really nice!)

The baggage handling at CDG was excellent.  But I am sorry to say that SFO baggage handling is getting worse year by year.  This time it was 1:15 after clearing immigration before we saw our bags.  That is NOT AF's fault, but the fault of the SFO-employed baggage handling staff.","2018-10-02"
"3","Questionable schedule","We booked our flight from LAX to PPT roundtrip for our anniversary and 2 days before our trip,we got email from Air France announced the delay of the outbound flight 14 hours later due to weather.
We called the airline and assumed that the same flight on Air Tahiti is not available neither.
Due to the complexity of changing the hotels 2 days before the trip is too expensive and Air France might not reimburse for it because of weather related reason.
We decided to book the flight 24 hours later and loose 1 day of hotel in Moorea.
Almost 10 days later, we were our inbound flight back from PPT to LAX, we discovered the outbound flight on Air Tahiti Nui wasn't cancelled .
   This is disturbing and if we would know, we would request to book our outbound flight on Air Tahiti Nui so we don't have to loose 1 day of hotel in Moorea.
    We like Air France service on board but so disappointed about their schedule.
We will be very hesitated to fly w/ Air France again in the future.","2018-10-02"

"2","Connecting Flight to JHB Cancelled!","A long trip to South Africa from Cyprus, we find out our connecting flight in Paris was cancelled. Technical problems on the plane apparently. 

€15 vouchers were issued, for very selected airport stores such as poor sandwich shops or Starbucks. We were scheduled on Air Ethiopia to JHB. At the boarding gate we were REFUSED to board because the AirFrance clerk failed to print our boarding passes for us! At this point we didn't even have normal tickets, just old school receipts they casually handed us. 

French police kindly escorted us allllllllll the way back (20 minute walk) to AirFrance desk. We were then scheduled on AirFrance flight for the NEXT evening, 11pm. 

We were given little 'lunch boxes' of snacks (revolting tinned tuna salad that really tasted of cat food) and were put up in B&B hotel. Luggage locked away in airport - no access. After waiting 25 mins for the bus to B&B we arrive at a very disappointing 2* hotel. The most basic bathroom I have ever seen. We had to pay €5 EACH for a little toothbrush.

Eventually 11pm the next day arrives as we board the plane, 1 day late for the wedding plans in SA. My partner and I get SEPARATED. No seats together. I'm tiny, my legs were squashed. Plane felt old. Dinner reminded me of plane food in the 90's. 

Finally we land in SA, my boyfriends suitcase: LOST. They issue him a €100 voucher and off to the shops we mission to buy him all the basics, for Winter. Exhausted. 

Took 2 days to get to SA from Cyprus. A horrible start to our annual holiday. 

We claimed the €600 cash refund rather than the €800 voucher with AirFrance. 3 months later and still no refund in our accounts...","2018-10-02"
"2","baggage cost","reasonable price and on time service.  BUT watch carefully the weight of your baggage and your specific flight.  The normal policy only allows 12kg (25lbs) for your TOTAL carryon bags.  Most airlines allow 22 (45lb - up to 50 lbs).  Your checked bag can weigh 50.  And there is a reasonable fee if you prepay, but VERY expensive to check at the terminal.  Plus you have to go back to the ticket counter to accomplish that.","2018-10-02"
"1","Checked -in and chucked off!","I booked a return flight to Shanghai with Air France via Paris. The outward leg was fine, good food comfortable seat and a couple of hours lay-over at Charles de Gaulle. The trip back was a nightmare, saved only by British Airways.

I knew I would have a ten hour lay-over in Paris on the return leg and had arranged to meet friends there. I checked in on-line and had paid £36 for a duo seat in the upper cabin. When I got to Pudong to hand-in my luggage, there was a long queue and only two staff checking in passengers.After over an hour's wait I got to the desk only to be told that the plane was full and I had been reallocated to a British Airways flight. I was offered the choice of 150 Euros in cash or 300 Euros in vouchers for Air France as compensation. I then had to go to the BA ticket desk and then to BA check-in. 

The BA flight was direct to London so I arrived early, which meant that the rail-ticket I had booked to Bristol was invalid and I had to buy another and my friends in Paris were inconvenienced. 

Air France's after-service was equally appalling. I had opted for the cash as I have no intention of ever travelling Air France again and was given a Service Desk number to call with my code for payment. I tried on four or five occasions and each time was cut off when I opted for the English language service. I then used the online message site which crashed on at least three occasions before the claim was finally accepted.

After a few days I received a generic email stating that I would be paid in three to four weeks and then another email saying that the £36 would be refunded direct to my debit card in a few days. That was over a month ago and I have still not received any payment.

I have emailed them several times since then and still only receive emails saying that the payment will be made in 'weeks'. It is still impossible to get an answer from the 'Service' desk number.

My advice is never travel Air France, this is the worst experience I have had in thirty years of travelling.","2018-10-01"
"2","Premium Economy to Paris","Premium Economy seats are uncomfortable.  Seat bottom poorly padded.  I needed an inflatable seat cushion to be able to sleep on it.  Neither my wife's nor my remote control worked, even after the flight attendant rebooted them.  And the rolls for both meals were the worst I've ever had on a plane.  Hard, stale, flavorless white flour rolls.

Flight from Paris to Venice was over 3 hours late, causing us to miss our pre-booked food tour.  Return flight from Paris to SFO was 1-1/2 hours late.","2018-10-01"
"2","Disappointed","Our flight originated in Marseille Airport with a connection through Charles De Gaule to JFK. The baggage check-in at Marseille was confusing with not enough staff on hand to handle the surge of passengers checking-in. The Air France staff at check-in were grudgingly helpful. The gate agent had no microphone to announce the boarding of rows thus it was a bit chaotic. Arriving at CDG there were no Air France personnel around the terminal to help you find your way to the connecting flight to the US. Our flight to JFK was aboard a new Boeing 777. The airflow onboard was warm and stuffy with no fans above your seat to get any fresh air. It was all controlled centrally.","2018-10-01"
"5","As a proud Brit and European British Airways should hang their head in shame ","My partner and I flew with AF from LHR to JNB with a short hop to CDG.

The business class on short haul is a standard layout (3 seats with the middle blocked out) leg room good but we were in 1D and F. Service nice and in a forty minute flight still got a snack and a drink. It was the usual boarding chaos but not really their fault.

CDG is an odd airport is all I can say but the lounge in hall K was comfortable but a little crowded.

The CDG to JNB was on a 777 and with the ‘new’ business class seats so fully lie flat seats. I’m a big lad 6’5” tall and broad but the seats were roomy and private and just about long enough to lie down on when fully reclined.

What made it for us was the crew and how attentive they were. BA crew are very good but the product is now letting them down. AF have great product, great food and great staff. I slept for 6 hours on a 10 hour flight and even got to practice my French which the crew managed to smile through!

By the way the pricing was much lowered than direct BA flights and just this journey moved us up a notch in Flying Blue.

The food  was average ..","2018-10-01"
"3","Disappointing flying experience","The aircraft on this route was old. It was much less comfortable than my previous flights with Air France. The food was mediocre at best and the service quite mean. I would have expected a 10+ hour flight that spanned both lunchtime and dinner time would have warranted 2 full meals, rather than a meal for lunch and a snack for dinner, especially as arrival time was 2230 (too late to eat). The advertised ice cream service did not materialise.
The premium economy cabin was under staffed. I rang the bell for the stewardess once and she never arrived before the call light switched itself off a while later.
The entertainment system was poor. The screen was faded and had lines through it. The system was switched off a few minutes before landing meaning I missed the last 10 minutes of the film I was watching.On previous flight the entertainment system had been left on until the ‘plane reached the gate. And the choice of films was worse. I didn’t see any recently released films. Considering the route, I was hoping to watch Madagascar. But it was not an option.
It seems that Air France does not care too much about this route as there is virtually no competition. That’s a shame because previous flights have been much better.","2018-09-23"
"4","Mixed experience. Could improve.","I use this flight regularly, and most of the time it has been a good experience. Flight attendants have been helpful, food selection on board better than average, flights on time, boarding expedite.

"2","Do not fly AF if you have connecting flights. You will not get your luggage in time.","A vacation trip in Bucharest was partly ruined because Air France failed to deliver my luggage at destination in time. Traveled from NY to Bucharest - two segments: NY to Paris - 2 hours before connecting - Paris to Bucharest.
The plane departed late from NY, then it was delayed at the gate in Paris.  The luggage did not arrive in Bucharest. After many  complains and talks, I received the luggage  after four days. No apologies, no compensation for trying to be on vacation with the same clothes for FOUR DAYS. In addition my reservation for seating ( for which I paid extra) was cahnged without my advice. The plane was cramped.
 Food was  good and personnel on board very nice. That was the only good part of this experience. Never Air France again.","2018-09-22"
"3","Brilliant then a nightmare","I had special assistance for my trip to Bordeaux, but was disappointed that I couldn’t fly direct so had to change terminals and flights in Paris and even though I was flying with Air France for both sections of the journey, the time from arrival and departure in Paris was only one hour.  The special assistance from Newcastle to Paris was brilliant.  Air France staff member, Clare, in Newcastle was brilliantly helpful.  The plane was late in leaving but made up time on the journey, so anxiety about being in time for connection was allayed immediately upon arrival.  However, special assistance people ( there were three of us) were taken off the plane and put sitting in a room and we were told to wait.  We waited, and waited and waited and no one came for about twenty five minutes.  I mentioned the time of my connection, but the helper just shrugged.  We were eventually put into a mini bus and seemed to go endlessly round the airport, finally stopping to let a member of staff off.  Off we went again on this cruise around the airport and finally stopped at a gate in the correct terminal, but not mine.  It was for the other special assistance passenger whose plane was due to leave later than mine.  By this time I knew my connection must have left, but when the driver of the mini bus became aware of my concern, he told me that my flight had been delayed.  From then on I seemed to be passed from one person to another and then finally met John who took me to the gate.  In fact, I was left there, sitting in a wheelchair for some considerable time because the connecting flight was delayed by three and a half hours.  I had had a very simple, not very nice, snack on the plane from Newcastle, but neither anything to eat or drink until I was on the flight to Bordeaux.  That flight was alright once it got going, but I was left to see to myself on arrival, being told the distance out was fairly short.  I don’t think I will fly with Air France again.","2018-09-22"
"1","The worst ""normal"" flight that one can imagine","Air France used to have a great tradition but it has lived way too much on it. I have travelled in the last two weeks to New York from Paris and from Rio de Janeiro to Paris just yesterday. The first two of the planes were 777-200s while the last one was a 777-300. I do not know how old were these planes were. But the first one felt really really old. The second one was at best average, while the third one was clearly below average. And these planes were nevertheless full. Incredible? At least very very strange. I prefer to stop here my rendition of the terrible decline of what used to be a flamboyant company, Air France.","2018-09-22"
"2","Ancient miserable plane CDG to,BLR","Plane was outdated and extremely cramped. Especially not happy with extra wide arm rest as it made me feel even more cramped. Tv screens very small with few choices compared to other airlines plus multiple reboots giving downtime of 40+ minutes. Service was good and food was better than average for economy. Dirty lavatories.","2018-09-22"
"5","This is the way a traveler should be treated!","From the time we approached the service desk to check our bags til we stepped off the airplane, we were treated like we were special.

The staff were friendly, helpful, cheerful and the whole trip made me decide to always fly Air France when I have the option.  Viva La Air France","2018-09-22"
"3","First time flying Air France and definitely our last","There were no direct flights from Washington, DC to Athens, Greece so we had a connecting flight through Paris. Since it was going to be a long flight, we decided to splurge on Business class in the hopes we would be able to get some sleep on the flight. The day before departure, we received an email from Air France indicating that the aircraft from Paris to Greece no longer will accommodate Business class travel and therefore we were being bumped to Economy. There was no explanation for the change or what we needed to do to get a refund since we paid for Business class. Both my husband and I called Air France and were told to contact customer service AFTER our flight to request a refund. We also learned from that phone call that even though we had selected our seats to be together at the time of making our reservation, they could no longer accommodate our seat request and we would be sitting separately.

The flight out of Washington, DC was delayed. We sat on the plane for almost 2 hours while the plane we being refueled. Because we were so late to take off, we arrived late in Paris. We had to run to make our connecting flight. When we got on the aircraft to Athens, we discovered there was indeed a small section for Business class travelers. We could not understand why we weren't put in that section since we paid for Business class. Instead, we were sat separately in the very back of the plane. One seat was in the last row against a wall so the seat could not recline. 

When we arrived in Athens, we discovered our luggage was not on the plane. Air France as able to locate our luggage and we were told it would be on the next flight out of Paris. We decided to wait at the airport for the plane to arrive so we could get our luggage otherwise, Air France could not guarantee our luggage would be delivered to our hotel that night. Because we waited at the airport for our luggage to arrive, we missed meeting the driver we had arranged to take us to our hotel. We were charged $100 from the car service company because the driver spent time at the airport waiting for us. 

This was our first time flying Air France and we were not impressed. We experienced multiple problems. We have been back from our vacation almost 2 months and we are still waiting for a response from Air France re: refunding us the ticket price for Business class vs Economy. Their system for filing a complaint/claim is all automated. You can try to contact customer service, but they aren't much help and instruct you to fill out a online claim.","2018-09-22"
"1","Avoid at all cost","This was our honeymoon trip and me and my wife were not seated together, even though the tickets were purchased together on the same booking. If I wanted to change the seats I had to pay and the customer service representatives at Charles de Gaulle airport did not show any interest to resolve my problem. They blamed it on me and kept repeating like a broken record ""Zue Sistem"". I have never had this problem with any other airline, seats were always together. For our honeymoon we had 6 different flights with 4 different airlines, and this is the only one that failed to seat us together.

The flight crew did not care either. I had to go around asking people to change seats, basically blocking the aisle and delaying loading of the plane, still they did not care and did not want to help at all. 

If you want your family to seat together for your trip choose another airline.","2018-09-22"
"5","Fall 2018 trip","The flight took off and landed at exactly the advertised times.  For a smaller plane, there was a surprising amount of legroom.  Beautiful flight, right over the Alps and into Venice.","2018-09-22"
"5","Great flight - on time and well looked after","I had a connecting flight from Birmingham to CDG. The transfer was easy and my bag went straight through to BA. Boarding was efficient and quick on both flights. Staff on board were polite and efficient. I loved the menu card that was given out so that you know what choices of food you had. Seat was comfortable and I had plenty of leg room 
(I am 5'10""). I was in a Duo seat. Before the flight the email communication was good keeping me informed about my flight. Highly recommended and I think great value for money. My only suggestion to make this trip even better was if WIFI was available.","2018-09-22"
"4","Very nice airlines","First time on Air France and it was impressive. Very nice airplane based on quality and overall condition. The food was ok as well. Highly recommend this airlines.","2018-09-22"
"3","Must improve seat booking","When you buy a ticket on-line, you don't know where you will be seated nor Air France allows you to see it. Only at check-in time, ie 30 hrs before the actual trip, you can view your seat number and eventually buy an option for changing the seat. In our case, it meant that I had to be up at 6:00 am the day before in order to view our seat allocation. Of course, we were assigned seats at the back of the plane and I was ""convinced"" that I needed to change seat. Of course, the only remaining seats were the exit seats for which you need to buy the option. Why don't we get the possibility of buying seats at booking time?","2018-09-21"
"3","Good Service on Air France","It is hard to differentiate between the major airlines but I have found on my recent flights across the Atlantic with Air France that their customer service is pretty good.  Yes, Premium Economy is just up from Cattle Class, the food and drink is the same (very average), but friendly staff make a difference.  You get a better seat (it doesn't go anywhere near flat, but it has a hard shell so that when the person in front tips their seat back, it doesn't invade your space), a little more room and a little goodie bag with socks, toothbrush etc.","2018-09-21"
"1","Lost Baggage X 8","My wife and I had two recent experience travelling on Air France. First time was in December 2017, we were travelling from Washington, DC to Cotonou, Benin. My wife's luggage did not arrive at Cotonou for about 48 hours after we arrived. Fortunately, we were visiting our son, so he helped us buying the essentials. The recent experience was more terrible. We were travelling from Washington, DC to Cape Town, South Africa in September 2018. When we arrived at the Cape Town Airport at 9 PM on September 4 the luggage of all of us did not arrive with us. So most of our first day in Cape Town was spent in buying the essentials. My advise to other travelers, don't fly on Air France if you have checked luggage. For us their batting average in lost luggage is 100%. I guess it cannot be any worse.","2018-09-21"
"5","Great flight from Denver to Paris","We were super impressed with Air France, the flight attendants were efficient, the food was great (we were served 2 meals on the flight from Minneapolis to Paris), flights were on time and the gates in the connecting city were close together. Plus the ticket prices were a steal. We would definitely fly Air France again!","2018-09-21"

"5","Smooth sailing on Air France Flight","I do not have any complaints about Air France.  There was polite assistance given where needed.  They were generous with the baggage allowance and didn't charge needlessly.  Everything was on schedule.","2018-09-21"
"5","Great Service","Great Service, enough leg room (and I am 6"" 2') The price was not much more then the economy class, preferred service on the airport (fast lanes). Great!","2018-09-18"
"5","New Style Business Class Experience","We always travel Air France to Paris from South Africa since you cannot get a business class seat on SAA for love or money, apparently too many public servants on 'official business' , according to that airline's ticketing office. We used to fly First Class until we landed in Air France Affairs, or business class, on one of our flights due to a mishap when booking flights. We were very pleasantly surprised to discover they have a very good business class section, not unlike the first class in fact. Your seat does not convert into a completely flat bed like first class but gets close to that. The menus are quite comprehensive and a choice of 3 carefully composed main course meals are offered. Although not as lavishly presented as in first class, very good nonetheless. I actually prefer the business class menu as I do not eat much on a flight but prefer to get it over and done with, rather sooner than later. Orders are taken and recorded on iPads connected to iPads via Bluetooth, used by other crew. Thus they co-ordinate available meals and service for each section. I would imagine this is to speed things up as previously dinner could take up to two hours. It certainly worked well and we were ready to retire in slightly more than an hour after the pre-dinner drinks came around. We enjoy the professionalism and friendliness of the Air France crew. I can recommend them 100%.","2018-09-18"
"3","Air France is changing it's Executive Class product - and not to the better","In the past years years, I have traveled regularly between Brazil and Europe in the C cabin and mostly with the Air France.
While on July 23 on the long-haul GRU - CDG (AF 457) at least the food service in the C was still ""as usual"" - the different courses were served separately - there was a significant reorientation on my return flight on 4 of September.
There was then a tray with the appetizer, the salad, the cheese and the dessert served. Here only the starter with the main course was replaced later.
I must honestly confess that I had especially liked the presentation of the food on the Air France C class. It has always been a pleasant expression of the French way of life.
But this seems to have become the victim to some cost cut actions between July and September this year.
I think it's a pity that such a differentiating feature (even to the group partner KLM) has now apparently been pulped.
Several airlines offer a C-Class seat in 1-2-1 configuration on the 777 nowadays. Differentiation characteristics are actually only to be generated by the service and details.
It is disappointing that Air France applied its cost cutting measurements at such a visible spot for their high-end customers. 

I shared this experience with the group members of a Facebook frequent traveler group and realized that this change did not just affect this route but that the change had been implemented globally.

Besides they seem to struggle with their customer care in general. Complaints take an unusual time to get taken care of and then the response might not be satisfactory.

So far, I've been very enthusiastic about the Air France C product. Unfortunately, that's just changing .... I was recommended to Alitalia and I might take that in consideration in future.... or moving towards KLM. They are not known for their excellent food service but they have internet available on their long-haul flights to Brazil, which AF still does not offer. In addition, they give this nice porcelain house as a thank you at the end of a trip in the C cabin","2018-09-18"
"5","Overnight first class was my first!","My husband and I decided to experience an overnight transatlantic flight and it was worth the extra money. Our seats stretched out to a long pod and were way more comfortable than the economy flight would have been. Of course, the food and service were what you would anticipate in this class. If we can afford an upgraded class for an overnight in the future, we will definitely do it.","2018-09-18"
"4","Unexpectedly great flight!","This flight reminded me of what transatlantic travel used to be like, 15 or more years ago...  Wet napkins at the beginning of the flight, a beautifully made menu, ""apero"" before the meal with sparkling wine among the offered drinks, and a nice choice of digestives after the meal (all included in the price of the ticket, economy class). And a new airplane (Boeing 787 Dreamliner).","2018-09-18"
"4","flight to Paris","was good--better than expected. Food was certainly better than any domestic economy flight. The attendants were very good.","2018-09-18"
"2","Horrendous","I'm such a devout Delta customer & was so disappointed by this partner.
1. A late first leg left me and my 75 & 80-year old parents + a toddler scrambling to make a connection in Paris.  I'd arranged for assistance for my dad, who can't walk quickly, as I assumed it would be a big airport.  They told me I had to wait for everyone to disembark before the assistance would arrive, which meant we'd most certainly miss the tight connection.  So I had my poor parents stressed and running through a major airport.
2. They lost my luggage BOTH WAYS!!  we waited 3 days in naples (that's an entirely separate & horrible review).  Every time I called the airport no one answered.
3. The ""upgrade"" to premium economy was entirely BS.  The only perk was sitting further up front, but there were no extra amenities and definitely no more room in the seats.  that was a complete scam

flight attendants weren't very friendly or helpful","2018-09-18"
"2","Lost my luggage for 2 days and didn't seem to care.","Luggage didn't make flight.  Arrived 24 hours later on another flight but it took another 24 hours for Air France's so called luggage service to actually deliver our suitcases to our ship.  Was told by many that this is typical Air France service and they were uncooperative and uninterested during repeated calls from the ship to their luggage dept.","2018-09-18"
"3","Great in the Air, but...","My wife and I recently flew to Paris on Air France (a Delta partner) at the start of a 2-week, 3-country trip to Europe.  Loved the flight.  Hated the food--I asked in advance for a vegetarian meal.  It was inedible.  What's worse, Delta also screwed up my request and somehow my wife also got a vegetarian entrée which she didn't order and thought it to be terrible, as well.  The worst was yet to come.  When we landed at Charles de Gaulle airport and taxied forever to a distant gate, we had to wait 45 minutes after deplaning before our baggage came down the chute--UNFORGIVABLE.  The French workers must have been engaged again in one of their all-too-frequent slowdown protests.  We've flown out of CDG before, but this was our first arrival--and our last.  In the future, we'll bypass CDG for more passenger-friendly airports such as Amsterdam and Zurich, both of which have always been trouble-free in the past (--as was Orly, in bygone days).","2018-09-18"
"4","Best onboard service","No airline is perfect but when it comes to onboard service and food, Air France  is amazing. They know passengers can choose their airline and want you to have the best possible experience. Entertainment is outstanding with a huge choice of international movies. We have traveled in all classes: economy, premium economy and business, depending on the length of the flight and special offers. Economy is never great on any plane and any airline, but the Air France makes special efforts for all its passengers.","2018-09-18"
"5","I'm hooked!","I love Europe but dread the flight.  Air France made it a pleasure!  Comfortable seats, very good food, amazing entertainment options and exceptional service far exceeded my expectations.  For the first time ever, I was able to sleep for more than an hour.  Thank you!!","2018-09-18"
"3","Unnecessarily awkward","The aircraft was roomy and comfortable and the personnel were professional, timely, and helpful.  The awkward part of the trip took place when my wife and i were placed on different sides of the plane.  I sat next to a single passenger while my wife sat net to a couple.  Our seats had been next to each other but were changed which doesn't make any sense.  Since I was in a two seat configuration why not let my wife sit next to me instead of someone I have never met.  This is the second time this has happened on Air France which will give me pause should an agent suggest that airline again.  To make matters worse our seats were confirmed together months in advance.","2018-09-18"
"4","Business class seat not up to competitors standards","Whilst all aspects of the airline including staff service, food etc., are very good, the business class seat is not a lie flat, is very tight and has no privacy screen between the seat and neighbours seat. So whilst the airline is very good, the business class is not up to the standards of the competitors.","2018-09-18"
"5","Family Fare from CDG to Marseille, less expensive than train","Flew into CDG on Delta from San Francisco.  Were renting a place in Provence near Avignon and had the option of taking the train or flying.  It was less expensive and less time to fly in our case, especially with the Air France family fare which I beleive is good within Europe for a family of 4 or more.  You need to indicate you are a family on line when purchasing the tickets and will be asked to present yourselves at boarding as a family.  You may also need proof of relationship.  Our brought our 19 year old twins birth certificates but we were not asked for them.  You can only bring one bag on the plane, but our fare included a checked bag at no cost.  It was a bit confusing when we checked our bags as I had printed the baggage tickets out at home before leaving, but there was no way to attach to the luggage - an Air France employee in the baggage area gave us a plastic holder for the baggage tags, but I think it might be easier to print the baggage tags from one of the baggage check machines.   We were told the lines might be long getting through passsport control at CDG, but it was not bad - we arrived about 10:30 am.  The domestic terminal is not right next to the international terminal, so allow time to transfer.   The domestic terminal was very crowded.  Flight to Marseille was fine and we walked outside to the Enterprise building to pick up our car.  Very easy.  We took the train back to Paris from Avignon and dropped our car right at the train station.","2018-09-18"
"4","Flight experience was terrific, except...","...Air France does go on strike occasionally.  Luckily our flight was not affected.  Just be aware of this possibility.  They do make the strike days public ahead of time.  While traveling in Europe, we had to check a week or so ahead of our planned departure to see if we had a flight home or not!  We would fly Air France again without any hesitation.","2018-09-18"
"1","Air France to Italy","This airline checked my bag on June 18 for a 11-day trip to Italy and it was not to be seen again until July 4, 6 days after I returned from my trip.","2018-09-18"
"5","France Travel","LOVE Air France.  It was my best flightS ever (roundtrip).  The stewardesses and stewards were ALL friendly, and SOOO nice.  The flight was smooth. The food was great.  The alcohol was free.  It was just the best ever.   There was a small dog right next to me and and a larger dog in the seat in front of me.  The animals were super quiet.  It was just a fabulous flight and a fabulous vacation too.  We had one problem, but it was corrected.  Our return flight from Montpellier to Orly was late.  We arrived at checkin a few minutes late and was told I could not check in.  After I told them the flight was late, they reopened checkin.  Weird... we just got at the end of a VERY long security line.  I don't know why they made such a big deal (at checkin Orly)","2018-09-18"
"5","Old school charm on Air France","Air France proved there still exists that old school charm and feeling that they really care about the people flying with them.The stewards and stewardesses were extremely attentive, constantly going down the aisle to provide service, good food, ice cream, keeping many snacks and drinks in kitchen near bathrooms, always extremely pleasant.The bathrooms were kept clean, the flight was smooth. Nothing can be done about the physical discomfort of a long flight, but their attention to their individual clients was appreciated. I will definitely try to fly Air France whenever I can in the future and recommend them to others.","2018-09-18"
"1","Air France makes Delta look good","Air France always finds a way to piss me off. From my first flight in 2010, when they lost our plane in Philadelphia and cut 2 days off my expensive European vacation for measly $100 per person and one night in a crappy hotel near JFK (first night they simply sent us home) to the transfer flight from Vienna last month. I bought tickets 6 months in advance, and they managed to sit us in the last toilet row on the first flight and in two different sections on the second flight. How can you not find two adjacent seats in 6 months on an A380 double-decker that seats over 500 passengers? Also, both planes were really old.","2018-09-18"
"3","Taped together","Air France is a tired old airline. My international flight was on a very old plane. For example, there were no ports to plug in electronic devices. My seat was missing the padding for one of the arm rests. It had been replaced with blue tape. The seat next to me had a torn pouch on the seat back in front of it. It was held together with blue tape. I had the suspicion that if I looked at the mechanical parts of the airplane, I would see blue tape.

The service from the flight attendants and the food were excellent. They really went the extra mile. The boarding and customs process was great.","2018-09-18"
"4","Food is good and service is well. However we could not choose the seat online unless we pay the extra fee to choose it.","We choose Air France because the time schedule was very convenient for our trip to Vienna. After work, we could jump in the flight from Tokyo Haneda to Paris and transit the flight from Paris to vienna. We could save time and spend all day after we arrived in Vienna. However we had an issue that Air France selected our seats automatically no matter when / how long ago  we booked. Two of us were separated to be seated so, we negotiated with agents at the gate and one of Air France japanese employee helped us to assign the seats next each other. He was very helpful and kind.","2018-09-17"
"5","Fine Dining in the Air?? YES!!!","The Air France flight crew was exceptional in their service and care for the passengers, What a difference in the food quality as well-Americans just do not demand quality from our domestic carriers, and do not receive anything close to the meals we were served.  The wine choices were from 3 whites and 2 reds.  One red, a blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Verdot, and Merlot, from Segla, in the Margaux region 2011 was so enjoyable and a great companion to our Veal Marengo (absolutely delicious).  All in all a wonderful French menu and service with a warm smile!","2018-09-17"
"3","Flight was ok outbound but return was canceled due to industrial dsipute","The outbound flight was from Toronto to Paris then from Paris to Birmingham UK.  This was ok and the flight left on time and I was able to get the connection. 
On the return, the flight was cancelled  due to an industrial dispute with baggage staff (apparently, quite common I hear!) and this caused major issues. I was notified by email (good thing I was monitoring mine!) and had to call Air France head office  rescheduling - this was very difficult to connect and when connected, was on hold indefinitely multiple times.  I called the London office instead and was booked on another flight from a different airport without any issues or additional costs.  I wish I had done that rather than wasting so much time and money on calls to France.","2018-09-17"

"3","Paris to Atlanta in Premium Economy","We had priority boarding and after they boarded the first class cabin, they just let everybody else go at the same time.  No priority there.  

This was a 500-passenger plane and Premium Economy, where we were sitting,  was full - all 30 seats.   The seats were like the old Business Class seats before everybody switched to the lay-flat seats in Business class  so they were pretty comfortable.  The configuration  was 2 - 4 - 2.  We were in the set of 2 seats.  Lots and lots of kids - more than half the people were children.  It was pretty loud.  Not AF's fault.  

The lunch was okay but the snack was terrible.  My fruit cup had fermented and the Flight Attendant forgot to give us our sandwich wraps.  Had to chase him down to get them.  There was no FA service much to speak of except when passing out the food.  I asked the FA for a soft drink and she told me to go to the galley where they had bottles of water and soft drinks along with cups and ice and help myself.   

We'd never flown on AF before and will not fly on them again.","2018-09-17"
"5","Provance","Air France has great seats very comfortable for an 8+ hour flight-F&B service is outstanding  - Flight attendants very friendly and engaging","2018-09-17"
"5","Last is best.","Such a great crew at making everyone and every language feel like a guest, not a customer. The food served as a preview of what we were going to enjoy in Paris. That kind of food in coach made me embarrassed for all of the American carriers. But the best surprise was by sitting in the rear of the plane, all of the crying kids faced away from us and the serve-yourself bar was just a few steps away. Actually slept well. Hint, go for the pairs of seats by the windows in the back.","2018-09-17"
"4","A flight with attitude, the right kind!","This was our first flight on Air France. We didn't know what to expect but the flight was calm and smooth. The cabin crew were wonderful. The food was a little strange but tasty and the crew distributed ice cream to everyone after dinner. It was fun. I would definitely fly Air France again with pleasure.","2018-09-17"
"1","nightmare","First off we thought it was a Delta flight but found out it was operated by Air France. From the very start things went from bad to worse. From Cancelled flight to going to a city and getting home a day later than we were supposed to. And to top it all off our luggage did not arrive for 9 days. I will walk before I ever fly Air France again","2018-09-17"
"4","Great Price But...","I paid about $550 per ticket in August. A really good bargain, however, the stewards and stewardesses can be a bit nicer. My 10 year old didn't like his food and when we asked for possibly exchanging, they said there are 500 people on the flight and they don't have any extras.  My kid wasn't offered any kids' package on the departing flight either but he got one on the way back.
Make sure you have at least 2 hours layover if your stop is in charles de gaulle airport. There is a passport check with long lines and if changing terminals, it can easily take 1 and half hours.
The flight was on time and the service was decent but not great. Food was mediocre, both for dinner and breakfast.  It was a great price but if I paid regular, I'd not be giving 4 stars :)","2018-09-17"
"5","A near perfect experience","On time departure and on time arrival. Boarding was efficient. Service and food were excellent. Once on the plane it was a very pleasant flight. 

The airport in Paris, Charles De Gaulle, was a different experience. Spread out, winding walkways, bus transfers, passport control nightmares (understaffed, long waits, almost rude staff). Every minute of our two hour layover was needed to make our connection.","2018-09-17"
"4","Oh, La La","We booked a long way ahead of the flight and thought we had a good deal.  Guess we did not read the fine print.  It turned out that we had to pay for checking bags.  As this was an international flight, definitely not what we were expecting. Each check in bag was $50 or $60 each way.  Service on the plane was good and we loved that meals were served with menus as though it was a restaurant.  And of course wine, even champagne is included, unlike the American airlines international flights.  
Not the fault of Air France but can something be done about the landing times at Dulles.  All the planes from Europe seem to land at the same time and the immigration department cannot cope.  We were there almost 2 hours.  At the end of a long flight this is unacceptable.  This is not a one off case we have been to meet people at he airport and had to wait hours as they have been held up in immigration due to long lines.","2018-09-17"

I have flown multiple times Air France and most recently in june prior to our August-September trip and never have been charged for 1 bag. In addition, I get first bag free with my platinum delta AMEX but I guess Air France ground agents don't know their own company rules. it is not about the $50 charge but about the principle and the way the agent was so rude.","2018-09-17"
"4","A bearable long flight","The service was very good and good flight entertainment.  The flight attendants could have served water more frequently and have more varied snacks in between meal service.","2018-09-17"
"3","Air France ticket but no Air France services... at all!","Air France does not fly from Australia but has agreements with partners. We decided to test a MEL-CDG trip via Abu Dhabi thru a flight operated by Etihad. Tickets were purchased on Air France website and paid with my Air France AMEX card also. My wife and I are both Platinum but we were denied any related perks when arriving at the registration counter (no possibility to checkin online either on AF or Etihad): No access to Premium/Business queue, no free upgrade for seat with more legroom, no express control, no lounge access either. 
Air France explained later that only their Skyteam partners allow for such services, which is a shame as this program has proved to be quite unsuccessful in growing a partnership w/ any major Gulf or ASEAN based company.
Otherwise, our flight to Paris on Etihad was quite nice and connection in Abu Dhabi smooth although a bit chaotic at boarding time (A380 thru a single gateway...).
We decided to upgrade to business class on our way back to Melbourne and were delighted with the quality of service Etihad offers, especially in the A380, putting Air France further down the ladder of excellence it once was on top.","2018-09-17"
"1","Horrible service","We flew to Budapest from JFK, changing flights in Paris. Despite a 1 1/2 hour stopover, the bags did not make the flight to Budapest. We were told that the bags were at DeGualle airport and would be on the next flight. They were not. Then we were told they would be on the 11:00 the next night. Still no bags. We departed on a river cruise, spending hours, trying to contact Air France. They DO NOT ANSWER THE PHONE! I tried 125 x one morning alone. The travel agent tried, consierge tried and Avalon cruises tried. After multiple and varied attempts, including Twitter, I found Facebook Messenger and got a canned response. Every day I told them where we would be docked. Other airlines were able to deliver lost luggage. Our luggage was NEVER lost. It was at the airport. I told them it contained needed medical supplies. When we got the luggage. Ten days later, items were missing. I had to miss some tours because I did not have my orthopedic brace and was in pain for weeks afterward. When we finally got the bags, two days apart and after ten days, they were marked RUSH! Their policy will only refund expenses seven days after receipt of the bags (shorter time than they had them). A friend waited three months for their refund! A mistake is ok. Incompetence and arrogance is not. I would never fly Air France again and would dissuade any friend from doing so.","2018-09-17"
"5","Excellent service","Excellent flight. The service was really good. The food was nice. The flight was on time. One problem was at Charles de Gaulle the combination was so difficult because I have to go through the check up 3 times before taking the next flight.","2018-09-17"
"5","Great airline!","We flew from Heathrow to Paris and back for a trip to Disneyland. The whole flight experience from booking, through checkin, the flight and arrival went smoothly. We bought the tickets during an online sale so we were super happy with the price too! The airline staff were all friendly and accommodating. Our flight home was slightly delayed but we were kept informed every step of the way and it just gave us time to enjoy a drink at the bar :-) 
I would definitely consider Air France again when choosing an airline.","2018-09-17"
"4","Premium Economy","Service on the flight was very efficient and friendly. The space in this class was smaller than expected and the manual adjustable seats are outdated and not a big step up from Economy. Terminal E at airport is being renovated and was a big disappointment in as far as restaurants and shops were concerned.","2018-09-16"
"1","Awful Experience","Dreadful experience and the last time I fly Air France. The plane must have been about 30 years old and seriously needs replacing.

"5","La Premiere Flight CDG to JFK. Pure Bliss","Oh my gosh.  This is pure luxury.

777 By Design Plane

The La Premiere (only) lounge is one of the best in the world.  The only passengers allowed in the lounge have to be 1st class, La Premiere passengers.  Someone's miles or credit card points aka debt will not let him in.  It makes for a very quiet and calm lounge, unlike other lounges where I've thought to myself ""this is as bad as sitting at the gate or a bar near the gate.""

The waiters at the beautiful restaurant were incredibly professional.  Wonderful alcohol selection.  The food was fantastic.  We got ""trapped"" there during a very bad snowstorm.  It didn't even matter.  I didn't want to leave the lounge.  There are no tvs telling you about the flight, because the flight attendants report back to you about what is going on outside of the lounge.  If something is wrong with the flight, they handle to logistics.  All you have to do is sit and eat and drink...and maybe get a massage or facial at the spa.  Ha!

Yes, it seriously doesn't get better.  Wait.  I forgot to mention, La Premiere means you do not wait in a security line.  They whisk you to the front.  It's almost embarrassing...but it's pretty wonderful (besides the dirty looks).  I get it.  People were angry and their flights were delayed.  I would have been ticked too.  Being on the other side was wonderful.  There was not one ounce of stress from the second you step into the airport.  Pure bliss.

The people who worked at the spa could not get into the spa because of the weather, so the flight attendant surprised me with vouchers for the spa at the Champs-Élysées location.  I think that's where the location is.  I could be wrong.  

When it was time to board the plane they take your luggage put it in a luxury car and drive you to the plane where you board through your own entrance.  It's amazing.  lol. It's almost ridiculous. 

We were constantly waited on.  We ate a huge amount of food and the champagne kept flowing.  I even tried the drink created by Colin Field.  I had to since I had taken a class by him at the Ritz during my stay.  

I told them I was so full and could I wait on my dessert.  That was totally fine :) 
I fell asleep and she was a little disappointed when I woke up because I forgot to tell her to make my bed.  lol.  Which means putting on the mattress.  
I had a question about a cheese and wine pairing and all of a sudden I had two attendants in a huge discussion about what I should eat with what.  It was very serious.  I loved it!

When we arrived at JFK reality hit.  Our flight was missed because of the snowstorm in Paris.  Someone was there to assist us, so that was good.  She even got us a cab (in front of the taxi line) and put us in a HORRIBLE hotel.  But, other than that it was an amazing flight.  It might be once in a lifetime.  I hope to be lucky enough to fly it again one day.  The only thing I would change is to make the seats a non fabric material.  It took in too many smells.","2018-09-15"
"4","Shabby chic?","Flying one leg of an extensive european tour with several family members, some of whom were elderly handicapped. All flight crew and attendants were wonderful and attentive! So much more care and amenities than any domestic flight. The meals were good. The flight was mostly smooth and I watched several movies. The plane is older, seats and decir a bit dated. The interior may have seen better days but overall I still felt a little pampered. Even enjoying my own row of seats in the very back of the plane. I would recommend booking the tail seats on these long flights. ","2018-09-15"
"3","Cramped Seat","Air France at CDG is a breeze for printing boarding passes.  We checked in online 30 hours before hand.  Everything is automatic/self service for printing boarding passes and printing checked luggage strips.  There are also self service weighing stations for your luggage.  While there are plenty of personnel around for assistance, it was not needed.  This was the quickest we've ever received boarding passes and dropped off our luggage.  The early time of 7:45 am might have been to our advantage also.  Boarding was also efficient. We were placed in Zoned lines ahead of time by personnel, then told to self scan our boarding pass and proceed to the plane.  The price was excellent since we purchased our tickets 6 months prior to our outbound flight.  However, the comfort of the seats and small amount of legroom is extremely uncomfortable for a 9 hour flight.","2018-09-15"
"4","Business Class / Canceled flight without warning, made it on a flight leaving minutes after finding out","We flew from Chicago to JFK to CDG.

The flight we purchased gave us hours and hours to relax and enjoy the lounge at JFK and give us enough ""safe"" time... where if anything got delayed in Chicago, that we would still be ok and make everything else on time.  It was well planned out.

First our luggage had a big issue and got stranded.  It was a miscommunication between Delta and Air France.  We went back and forth throughout terminals in JFK trying to figure out the mess.  
While we were standing at the Air France counter (not busy at all) all of a sudden a man who worked there started freaking out saying something along the lines of ""you have to go now!""  I was like ""huh? Our flight isn't for hours.""
He then said, ""no... your flight is canceled and you have to be on the next one that leaves soon"".  I was more than ticked, and also worried since I wanted to 777 Design By version of Business Class, which I payed a good amount of money for.  I did not want to be on a 380 (which as I remember, cost a little less and I could have taken direct from Chicago).  He gave me some snippy response about 777s and 380s flying in the winter over the ocean...don't know what that was about since we ended up on a 777 and I know 380s were flying...very weird.

Anyway,

We seriously started running, someone took us through security.

When we got to the plane, it WAS the 777 Design By Plane and the business class we paid for.  So that was good.
Bad...the switch of the flights made it that my husband was not seated anywhere near me on our romantic vacation and long flight!  
So we talked to a few people, flight attendants couldn't really do anything.  Eventually a woman moved so we could be next to each other.

SO.  After all that is where I give a 5 star review.  That is a beautiful plane, the food was fabulous, the drinks kept coming, the staff on board were very sweet and charming.  The business class experience is so worth it.  Great entertainment and music on the tv.  Seats were great.  I did a lot of YouTube research before and suggest the same!  If the trip is a big deal to you, figure out the plane you want!","2018-09-15"
"1","Very rude boarding crew","On Friday September 14th, I took flight AF1124 to Lisbon at 20:50. Flight was fine but the BIG problem was the crew at the gate doing the boarding. They started taking some people off the queue (myself included) and directed us to a separate one without explaining anything. Turns out it was to take cabin size bags to the hold. When I was asked to hand my bag, again with no previous conversation, I alerted the guy, politely, that this was not the way to handle it and that first, they should have asked for volunteers and, then, if no one or not enough people came forth, that they needed to communicate that they would be selecting bags to be taken to hold - they had plenty of time to do so and the boarding even started 10min later than predicted because of the aircraft. Anyeay, some people came forth and agreed with me. The guy immediately went MAD and started shouting at us, in a threatening manner, that he was going to call the manager and shouted 3 times ""OUT"",very very loudly and in an angry tone. He took us out of the queue he had put us in, pushing us, and said not to leave that place.
The manager came, and when I was starting to speak to her, she suddenly goes ""wait!"" - turns her back on me, leaving me hanging and went to do the plane boarding. There were 4 people doing the boarding there - she purposely didn't care. Of course, we didn't stay were we were told and went again to the queue we were at before taken out abruptly - THE BACK OF THE LINE!!- and no one came to see us.
The point I wanted to make was that I would happily volunteer to put my bag into the hold but they should consider to handle it differently to improve. THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER DUE TO VERY RUDE EMPLOYEES with no soft skills whatsoever. This type is employees need to understand that they are the face of the company.","2018-09-15"
"3","Flight delayed","This flight was scheduled to depart at 16:35 but left at 18:05.
Friendly drink and cookies service. We landed in Zurich at18:57. Seat pitch is narrow, I sat in 14D an aisle seat. Flight was quite full but passenger loading was fairly quick. In Zurich the waiting time for baggage was about 10 minutes hence within the average time.","2018-09-15"
"3","Late!","The aircraft was in Barcelona prior to picking up passengers from Paris to Naples. Thee were some issues in Barcelona and the plane was about 1.5 hrs late!!! The pilot apologized and explained the situation.
Later during the flight was bumpy and I guess the pilot has a hard time maneuvering. I could see an expression on his face when we landed. He was observing the passengers deplaning at destination!! and I guess he was being very thankful that all arrived safely.","2018-09-15"
"5","Excellent efficient service","This flight was lovely. The seats are really comfortable and the check in people were patient and easy to deal with. We were offered a seat move to have full rows which we declined but - How nice is that? The food is delicious and the staff were walking around welcoming regular frequent fliers .... I had never seen that before. The proficiency in language is impressive - after spending a week in Paris and barely getting by with my french, I really appreciated their fluency. I would definitely recommend this airlines-

Our luggage was handled well and promptly- Impressive","2018-09-15"
"1","May you pay for seat selection up front, then take those seats away","Paid for seat selection up front - a few months back - so I got seats at front of economy and I don't get my long legs jammed by the person in front reclining. I check in on the day before and now they've put us on the worst seats on the plane - non reclining seats jammed between reclining seats and the washroom. Find some another airline who will honour what you book.","2018-09-15"
"5","Perfect economy flight","No complaints at all. Flew (Boeing 777) to USA and we were in a two share seat which gave the impression of more leg room. The seats were comfortable. Good film choice, food and staff were very nice.","2018-09-15"
"5","Small jet, smooth flight","We flew Air France, operated by Cityjet. The plane was an AVRO85, small four-engine  commuter jet, . The flight was  smooth. Even though the flight duration was just over an hour, the crew managed to fit in a drinks service. Disembarkation was speedy, we were out of the airport fairly quickly","2018-09-15"

"1","0 for 3","First flight was 3 hours late departing, causing a missed connection. That forced a 12 hour layover. Second flight (10 hours) had no A/V system and it took us to a different destination. Third flight was canceled, forcing us onto an even later flight. We lost an entire day of our trip, with no apologies, compensation, or even an explanation. None of these delays were weather related. ","2018-09-14"
"3","Very tight leg room","I would not recommend flying with Air France on a long haul flight (business and economy). The seat was small and food was terrible. They tried to charge for every possible seat selection which said a lot about the airline and how they tried to maximise profit at every opportunity. Check in was extremely slow too.","2018-08-31"
"5","FLY WITH THEM IF YOU HAVE A PET","If you are flying with your pet you need to book the fly with AIR FRANCE. They are very supportive, They are willing, truely interested in your pet and in make him/her a comfortable flight!! The prices are very very competitive.

I highly recommend AIR FRANCE!","2018-08-31"

The Air France flight was pleasant enough, with more leg room than on Delta. The food was the best I've had, other than First Class on Delta.  The pear chocolate cake was so so good!  The flight attendants are pleasant and friendly.  Air France sent me two surveys  about the flight which I was happy to fill out both.  Each seat has a screen for movies, television shows, etc.","2018-08-30"

"5","Only a 1.5 flight and we still got a meal with wine!","Flew CDG to CPH. While it wasn't the cheapest, it was the most ideal flight time. We were surprised we got a meal plus wine! A far cry from when we flew NOrwegian Air shuttle but I also know we paid more for the AirFrance  flight. First check in bag is $25. Make sure you use the full weight allowance as if it looks like you have more than just a small bag to carry on, the security agents will weigh your carry on and if you are over the carry on weight limit and need to check more, AF will charge you big $$$$ since you already checked in one bag. This is not may favorite aspect of flying AF and going in and out of CDG but we are now used to it, However in flight meal and service is pretty good (unlimited wine!). Always enjoy flying AF contrary to the locals!","2018-08-29"
"5","Wonderful Air France flight from Madrid to SFO through Paris","Our first flight on Air France.  We were in their business class and the service was excellent. We had been in Spain for two weeks and it was a pleasant change to eat French food. Their lounge in Paris was very nice an they had an excellent wine selection to choose from along with a selection of entrees if you desired. Only issue was a boarding delay leaving Paris to San Francisco but overall once on board everything went fine. One nice touch they have is that approaching San Francisco the flight attendants came around to each of us an thanked us for flying Air France.","2018-08-29"
"3","Air performacne good-ground performance poor","we travelled from Seoul to Amsterdam via Paris. The departures in Terminal 2 Seoul went very smoothly and the lounge was run by Korean Air (SkyTeam) with good selection of basics in terms of hot/cold food and drinks. The boarding was also smooth with on time departure, in cabin service was no where near Asian standards, the western crew were quite indifferent to the passengers and more focussed on their ipads and meals. Entertainment selections were very biased towards French films and music (Korean Air also same) but had a few good English movies. We had a four hour transfer in Paris yet they lost our suitcase and we could not receive it for 5 days. My Wife was so upset and distressed at not having anything to wear or make up etc. The airline response was very poor and we called them so many times for updates but they just referred us to a website which was poorly administered and inaccurate. More than once we asked to escalate to a manger for support and the customer service operator just hung up the phone, a shocking example of poor customer service!   The bag was located on day 4 and forwarded to Dusseldorf but we could not get any confirmation from the customer service team.. In the end  we went to the police in Dusseldorf who recommended we go to the airport and speak directly to the baggage handling outsource company. We did so and they allowed us to see their storeroom to check for the bag, at that moment a trolley arrived at the baggage storeroom with our suitcase on it. It had been sitting on the luggage belt in Dusseldorf for the whole day!
If flying KLM / Air France fly without transfer or avoid Paris Charles De Gaulle if transferring !! Our long planned trip for a holiday became a nightmare.","2018-08-29"
"4","Usually good, sometimes unpredictable","I travelled several times with Air France. Planes and the airline's safety records are good. Flights are usually uneventful, but there are many strikes as compared to other airlines and once had problem due to overbooking, but finally it was solved. 
My last flight was a good experience, minimal delay, very friendly and helpful staff.","2018-08-29"
"3","Service is adequate .","Our first leg of our flight from Warsaw to Paris was uneventful but the booking agent only gave us a little over an hour between conecting flight to San Francisco. We were lucky that when we alerted personnel they moved us along and opened lanes for us to make it to,our gate . Flight attendants were kind and efficient , with a full flight i was impressed at the level of service. When we arrived in San Francisco we were on time BUT our plane was not able to proceed to the gate for over an hour and half . We sat on the tarmac , with some people and children becoming restless. Was not impressed that after sitting and waiting an hour and half on the plane,  our luggage did not appear for another hour. So we were put back two and a half hours , not acceptable after spending almost 14 hours in the air. This why i gave only 3 stars.","2018-08-29"
"4","In Flight - Great But....","Hard to rate, as once you are on the plane it was terrific. Good service, super food and beverage service, especially when not provided from Vancouver, although even that was far better than Air Canada or others. Downside to the 777 was that the seats were very narrow. Lots of legroom but if you are a wide person go somewhere else. 
However, and here's the downside, the people they have contracted for check in are totally hopeless. Just a mish mash, can't control the lines or what's happening, and then at the other end, no one directing you at Charles Degaulle, and then no luggage showed up at Florence and no one to help you. Had to buy clothes and toiletry, so we'll see how they are with our small claim. Probably the fault of the completely incompetent people at the Vancouver airport so can only fault Air France for their selection of contractor. Don't get the no English, el cheepo staff, pay a bit more and get people that know what they are doing. It's first impression that lasts.","2018-08-29"
"5","Great Premium Economy Seats","We booked a return flight on an Air France Airbus 380 from Paris in July.  We flew Business Class to France and all I can say is that for the difference in price we were really pleased with Premium Economy (PE).  First and foremost, the seats in PE have hard backs, so the space in front of you is yours and yours alone.  The seats slide forward to recline and aren't powered like in Business Class - no big deal and frankly the difference in the food was minimal.  If all the Air France PE seats are like these, they get my vote every time over the so called ""extra 4"" advertised on US carriers.","2018-08-29"
"3","Nothing fancy","I would classify them as an average airline with nothing fancy with regards to the experience. Their customer service is great and things move very efficiently in Paris (if you're transiting through).","2018-08-29"
"3","Good service, but often late, often on strike","I travel with Air France for business very often. Their service is quite good, but this company faces too many issues.","2018-08-29"
"1","Stress!!","This flight experience was a nightmare.  Gate info was posted then disappeared.  Seat assignments had to be done through customer service at the airport.  Customer service had no idea where to send us.  Told to check back.  Then told to go to a different terminal, exited that terminal only then told to go back to the same terminal and through security once again.  Found the new gate only to be told that that that gate was being held for the plane that didn't arrive to take off yet.  Wait for another gate assignment.  Move to that gate and partial board to buses we waited for for another hour to come since they didn't have enough buses.  Then taken off the bus to wait once again for more buses to arrive for all the passengers.    This could not have been more confusing or stressful for all the passengers.   Bused to the tarmac to then climb up to the board the plane.   This connecting flight run through Delta Airlines as I heard from some other passengers is constantly having issues.   Stress since we had a cruise to connect with.  

I would certainly recommend using a different airline if you have to fly between these two airports if possible.","2018-08-28"
"3","Air Craft is good, but service is hard to say, it depends on who you met.","Air Craft is good, but service is hard to say, it depends on who you met. Inflight service is very important but  Air France is unpredictable, it depends on attendent's mood.","2018-08-28"
"4","A380","Took Air France from Paris to Dulles earlier this month at the last minute as was apparent I would be bumped from an American flight due to space and the type of ticket I had.  Surprised to see an A380 at the gate.  This flight, one day after the end of the Tour de France, was also packed but I watched for 45 minutes while it was boarded.  When the line was all through I was able to get on.  The flight crew was very nice, the food fairly good and there were snack bars available in each section so passengers could help themselves to water, crackers and the like.  Well done AF!","2018-08-28"
"4","Very good direct flight to LA on Air France.","Flight was leaving at 1pm and landing at 4pm. So you got the morning to do last errands and you land in the afternoon enough time to pick your rental car, and go to your hôtel. You just need to stay awake few more hours and you then can have a full night and fight jet lag. Flight is smooth with new B777 very confortable. Large screens in economy. Food and service was good. I also like the keep water and snacks available all the time.","2018-08-28"
"5","Great service and smooth flight","Recently flew AF round trip from Atlanta to Paris and everything was as expected. The check-in was smooth and orderly, loading was organized and the in-flight service was impeccable. My third time to take this flight and each time it has gone well. I shall return!!","2018-08-17"
"1","Very Bad Lost Luggage Handling Service","I am very disappointed in Air France and I was expected a much better service! 
I flew on August 15th (8/15) from San Diego to Tunis (flights Delta 473, AF9, AF1184, confirmation # R6XXPT) and when I arrived to Tunis on 8/16, I found out that my luggage was missing. I filed a claim and was told that my luggage could come the following day (8/17) in a 9:00 am flight. It did not! I called Air France's customer service in Tunisia several times and no one was responding. You hear a ringing and then the phone stops ringing, and you are not given the chance to leave a message or there is not even an automatic machine telling you that the wait is such and such minutes... So I called Paris's customer service office and when I spoke to a rep. she mentioned that the luggage was supposed to be sent in the morning of 8/17, but for availability reasons it was not and did not give me anymore information other than I have to wait that it might show-up on 8/17 afternoon or 8/18 in the morning... and there I am, I am left stranded with no luggage. My initial flight took 26 hours door to door and now it is more than 30 hours after I landed and I do not have clothes to change or shower or do anything. I still do not know when my luggage is going to make to Tunis. I did all types of luggage tracking and it is not telling me when my luggage is going to make it to Tunisia. I will think twice next time before booking with Air France.","2018-08-17"
"4","Comfortable, pleasant, comparatively tasty food","AirFrance has worked with a focus to elegant simplicity.  

Service is professional, cutting-edge check-in and drop-off services in-airport.  Aircraft personnel are cheerful, welcoming, professional, kind.  Seats are comfortable and legroom is better than some, comfortable for average sized people (less than 6 feet tall) and movie choices were interesting.  Food was interesting and tasty, with many choices at purchase if you have special diet needs.  

My only caveat is Charles Degall Airport (CDG) in Paris.  It is  H U G E  and my process of check-in/bag drop took 40 minutes, passport check line took 40 minutes, baggage check took 30 minutes, and then I had to run down the enormous terminal to my gate number 52.  I was freaking out, even though I came 2 1/2 hours before my flight.  If you are going to be on a big plane (or there are any other big AirFrance planes leaving at your time) I would suggest 3.5 hours for check-in because the back-up at 2 hours is mind-boggling, and the distances you must cover can be vast.","2018-08-17"
"5","One of the best Airlines ","Let me first mention the airlines I have taken personally to compare: Delta, United,  American, Copa, Martin Air, KLM, Air France, Aeroflot, Cubana de Aviación and Southwest. Some of them have their goods and bads but I will only talk about Air France 

The service: excellent. They are very attentive to your needs. Very polite. 

The aircraft: excellent. I flew on their Boing 747 about 15 years ago and now on Airbus 380 two weeks ago. Same excellent service, enjoyable flight. 

","2018-08-17"
"4","Wonderful experienced crew","The plane was not new and neither was the crew. My remote control was not working, however, I had a touch screen and a lesson on how to manage, so it wasn't a problem.
The cabin crew were great, experienced and knew their job which they did brilliantly.
Air France has a web site that gives a phone number and a street address in Sydney,
The phone is disconnected and the address is a health fund building, who said the Airline hadn't been there for years. Not good enough Air France.
I know that you don't fly to Australia and maybe you don't want Australians to fly with you.","2018-08-17"
"5","Premium Economy worth the extra cost","Premium economy on Air France means much more than extra leg and hip room. The quality of comfort and service approaches what you get in business class. The seating across is 2-3-2, so of course my wife and I took the two-seat-with-window option. Meals were good and there were many drink options (I had a beer--no extra cost).","2018-08-17"

"1","THEY DO NOT CARE","DOGD. This is what they think of their clients. Even their Platinum clients. 

They lost my suitcase. But they REALLY DONT CARE. 

Now on day 5 since the lost bag. 

Here is how it went down:

At the arrival, they made me wait 1.5hrs to see the bag carrousel was empty to then tell me they already knew the bag was not on my flight. 

They tell you you have 150 cad per day to spend on needed clothing and toiletries. But is not the case later they tell you its only 150 csd in all. 

They promiss to call you (several times) but they dont. 

So you call them. They tell you nothing. You call them again. They tell you nothing. You ask them for guidance. They tell you NOTHING. 

To boot i have PLATINUM status so am supposed to be their top tier client. 

I told them i was appalled at the level of service, feedback, communication. They replied that it was not something they could manage.

I STEONGLY RECOMMEMD YOU AVOOD THIA AIRLINE LIKE THE PLAGUE.","2018-08-17"
"1","Awful avoid when you can","what an awful experience 
we arrived early that morning to drop our bags, the lady on the counter said to us we need to pay for our bags again???
I told her we already paid for two bags during the booking but she said I cant see it on my system, I told her the two names which the bags comes under then I showed her the boarding pass that I print at home showing clearly one big bag of 23KG hand bag & accessory bag while the other boarding passes just had hand bag & accessory bag she told me its just a picture???
then she asked me to shaw her a recipe to confirm that I paid for the extra two bags, so I have to get my laptop login to airport wifi get to my emails then get the recipe for her with the break down of the price & £97 paid for two bags guess what she said? no the payment is pending I didn’t how she knew that so I open my bank account goes back through my bank statement for the last two moth to show her that the money is out from my account in full despite all of that she still not convinced yet & she call some body over the phone who confirm every thing that I was try to say to her within two minutes, then picked up our bags & she didn’t even apologise or say sorry to us for wasting our time & keeping three children under five years standing & waiting for more than half an hour with embarrassment in front of other passengers then we been running through the security just to get to the gate & every one blamed us that we are late for our flight.
clearly he is very incompetent in her work but my question why she asked for evidence if she will not convince with them & why she didn’t call some body right from the start???
my return flight in two days time & I am really pessimistic about it.","2018-08-17"
"5","The best airline in my experience","In July 2017 I travelled with my husband and 15 year old son travelled to Europe and travel was arranged with 3 airlines Etihad, Air France and Singapore Airlines - Melbourne/Paris/Madrid, on return London/Paris/Singapore/Melbourne. All airlines were very good but our experience on Air France was outstanding, the best airline with whom we have travelled.  We travel to Europe or USA every 2 years over the last 25 years. Air France’s attention to detail sets it apart from other airlines.  The seats and flat bed were very good.  The food, wine, champagne and service were excellent.  The flight attendants were also excellent.","2018-08-16"
"3","Bad service","The flight departure was delayed, the seats were tight, about the entertaiment system, the screen small and it wasn't a touch screen, you must use a kind of remote control, but the worst part of the flight, the crew's service.","2018-08-16"
"1","lost baggage","They lost our bag 40 days ago, until now they didn't find it. After many many calls and  claims they offered only a small refund compared to what they made us lose. They should be professional and more organised. They negotiate with us as if we are asking for a charity not one of our rights as travelers.","2018-08-16"
"3","Good flight","Pleasant trip, on time from Moscow meal on board. Arrived Paris for next part of journey met with wheelchair on getting off the plane and directed to our net flight. Bit of a push anyone with a disability needs help it's a big airport to find your way around and if your boarding time is short as ours was it was good to have someone who knew their way around the airport. Arrived Manchester on time","2018-08-16"
"5","Flying in style!","After flying on many cutrate airlines where they charge extra for almost everything, it was a real pleasure to fly on Air France!  We were offered all the wine we wanted to drink.  Every two hours, more food, snacks and drinks were offered.  With the free headphones, we could watch an almost unlimited number of movies and television shows.  This was by far, my most pleasant flying experience.","2018-08-16"
"4","On time, polite staff","This long flight was made bearable by kind staff and on time departures and arrivals.  The food was served throughout.  However please note— the overhead bins are VERY SMALL— I have been flying internationally for many years and never have to Check this specific carry on bag.  However, with Air France they made me check it.  It arrived fine, but nonetheless I was very surprised.","2018-08-16"
"5","Fantastic flight with a little bonus","In April I flew from NTE to FRA via Paris. For the first time ever, I had to change from ORY to CDG in Paris and since I wasn't sure how long this would take, I left several hours between my connecting flight. 
I took an Embraer 145 from NTE to ORY and this was one of the most fun aircraft I have ever travelled in. TINY! The service on board was swift, it being only a 45 minute flight. But everyting was fine.
The airport change in Paris went surprisingly easily and I was left with a 4 hour wait in CDG for my connection to FRA. So I sat in the departure lounge and had just opened my sandwich, when the gate staff made announcement that my 17:50 flight to FRA was overbooked and they were seeking voluteers to be moved to the flight departing NOW. So I re-packed my sandwich and legged it to the counter where I received my new boarding pass and rushed to the gate.
Now, this is when the magic began to happen. According to EU passenger rights, you are entitled to a compensation payment when you're denied boarding due to overbookings. For a short haul flight it's a fixed rate of €250. However, if your alternative flight gets you to your destinations within or before your original flight, that is halved. So €125.
So I placed my claim with Air Fance and within an hour or so I received a confirmation and an e-mail explaining that due to the current strike situation, my claim would take longer to process than usual. However, within 30 days I received the money into my account along with another lond mail of apology and eplanation that sometimes flights are overbooked etc etc.
Now, I'd like to add at this point that I myself am an airline employee so I know how it works. And I know for a fact that it is highly unusual to have a claim processed so very quickly and with such friendly e-mail contact. (btw, I paid €100 for the flight.)","2018-08-16"
"5","Flawless","A flawless experience on Air France for my return flight from Rome, Italy.  We made the connection in Paris and boarded Air France for the long flight back to the US.  The level of professionalism was a pleasant surprise.  The plane was clean and crisp as was the inflight service.  The flight crew~ very polite and professional.  I will definitely fly Air France in the future.  Baggage restrictions~ equal to common practices found in the US.","2018-08-16"
"3","another not-so-great experience","Once again, AF has let me down.   My flight back to Genoa was delayed and we missed our connecting flight in Paris.  After arriving 1 hour late I ran all over the place looking for an Air France representative to rebook me for another flight.  I was sent to 3 different areas of the airport and given the lateness of the hour (10pm) the staff was either gone for the day or in the process of leaving.  I spent 30 mintes looking for someone to help me and finally found someone helpful who gave me a hotel voucher for the night and booked me on a flight the next day.  14 hours later, I made my connecting flight.  It is sad that the AF staff is generally so unhelpful. Perhaps it is because I am not French but in my experience, that Air France staff is not very friendly nor helpful.  I filed a claim for compensation but it take 30 BUSINESS DAYS for them to repsond.","2018-08-16"
"1","Bad service and delayed flights","I would rate Air France a minus if I could. Every single flight was delayed from Ireland via Paris to Johannesburg and back. My flight back was canceled and rebooked without my concent. This impacted my trip back and costs me an extra night in the hotel. KLM should be ashamed to be associated with Air France. I was on Sky Priority and they still let other on the plane before the Sky Priority passengers. They booked me back on CityJet to Dublin, and the seats are small and would work for children, not adults. I will NEVER fly Air France again, not even if they offer me a free flight.","2018-08-16"
"4","Very nice Business Class experience","I booked my Air France business class flight 2 month in advance to take advantage of a business class saver deal. It was well worth it! The cabin has a 1,2,1 configuration, which is especially nice, if you fly by yourself and want privacy. Food was great and of course french champagne. Sleeping comfort was good, but I would have preferred to have some kind of mattress to provide a better sleeping comfort. Video entertainment offered a good choice of international and french movies as well as TV series. I would not hesitate to fly with the again on a special fare like that time.
Just one  minus was the delay of about 2 hours of the flight, but having access to the business class lounge made the stay bearable.","2018-08-16"

"2","delayed luggage, very slow to send.","Didn't volunteer to assist my family even though we had a 2 year old daughter with us. It was still ok as we are ok to wait. 

Checked in 5 luggages together, yet 1 was missing. Luggage was located in the same day itself according to the system and picked up by courier. However, even though I was in the region for 5 days 4 nights, I had not received my luggage. 

Calls to check on delivery weren't also given. Mention that they will ask them to deliver as soon as possible however it wasn't given, 10 days since it was being misplaced/delayed, I had not received the luggage. Last check was that it was still in Nice airport waiting for delivery.","2018-08-04"
"5","La Premier - stellar!!!","So, I’m not gonna lie. Air France La Premiere is my all time favorite flying experience. My most recent trip in La Premiere was from Madrid to Johannesburg with a connection via Paris. 
The connection in Paris and the actually hard product on the A380 are the reasons for making this a truly spectacular experience. 
Upon arrival in Paris, we were being bused to the gate in the rain. I was the first person off the plane and a gentleman was waiting for me with an umbrella and walked me to a waiting Jaguar. Where he whisked me to the La Premiere connecting lounge. All passport and immigration is taken care of in a seemless manner. The lounge itself is a decent size and the restaurant’s menu is created by top French chef, Alain Ducaisse and is truly special. The showers and restroom are magical. 
When it comes to boarding, the same gentleman collected me from the lounge and drove me to the A380, where we boarded directly via elevator onto the plane. 
The La Premiere hard product of the A380 is the older version - but it is still very special!!! Unlike Emirates First - there is no shower on La Premiere. But there is a lovely changing room next to the toilet. Although a second toilet would, in my opinion, be better. 
The service, dining and beverages are all really lovely. The only down side is that the entertainment system is old. The screens are not HD. But I was planning on getting a great night’s sleep anyway. And this is where this is the best bed in the sky (that I’ve flown!) I slept a solid 8 hours to Johannesburg- arriving refreshed and ready to visit family!","2018-08-04"
"5","Impressive on the Ground","I arrived at CDG from my hotel at a very busy time in the Air France section. Having never flown out of there, I was a bit anxious to get through he airport smoothly.  An Air France employee obviously noticed this and offered immediate help.  

Then later the same morning, I had another question and like clockwork another employee asked how they could help.  

My flight was a codeshare with Delta, so I have no experience with them in the air, but their ground service was spot on.","2018-08-04"
"5","Best airlines to fly to Paris","I flew this airlines more than once and services are consistently great. From the comfort of the seats that recline, to the inflight entertainment words can’t explain the experience. I can only imagine what their first class services are. During the flight we were giving head sets, pillows and blankets. They fed us about 4 times, with a menu option where you get to pick your meals. Unlike the horrible experience that I had with other airlines which made me realize how good I had it with Air France. Not everyone on the plane eating the same thing. Wine and champagne was in abundance. Tea was provided in a for of tea bag and hot water. Unlike the other airline that I previously wrote a review about. The tea is already made for everyone. If you wanna experience first class services as an economy traveler, this is the airlines for you. From now on I will not fly to France if it’s not with Air France.","2018-08-04"
"5","Delayed baggage handled superbly","I have flown a number of times through Paris CDG, with Air France, despite all my friends' warnings about delays, missed connections and lost luggage. I always enjoy their crew, and their safety video is the best I've ever seen.
Well, it had to happen one day: My luggage didn't make the connection. It was a bad surprise to find out the conveyor belt had stopped, and neither did I enjoy queuing to get a confirmation that seems unnecessary in the digital age, when the airlines already know your bag is still in Paris. 
But from that point on, their customer service did the impossible and turned that into a (slightly) positive experience. Sure, never having trouble is preferred, but sometimes it happens, and then it really unveils how a company treats its customers, when there is an unpleasant situation, and perhaps even somewhat exceptional. I actually didn't just wait for my baggage to arrive, checking the status online, but I made a phone call to find out the usual delivery schedule, and later I wrote an e-mail to get a detailed written confirmation. I wouldn't be much surprised if their agents were clearly stressed by hordes of unhappy travellers, but it wasn't the case at all. Not only did I get more-precise-than-expected information quickly, but I had a strong feeling their staff did care about the problems they had caused (well, now I realize it was actually the airport's, not AF's, fault), their apologies sounded very true, and as they understood my needs, they managed to deliver the baggage sooner than usual.","2018-08-04"

"1","How is it possible?!","During our 6 days stay in the South of France, Air France managed to loose our suitcase twice! Once during the transer on Paris Charles de Gaulle bringing it to our holiday house on day 3! And the managed to get ot lost again when we flew back on day 6....... unbeliefable! Never again Air France!","2018-08-03"
"5","Great experience twice so far","I have flown Air France to and from Paris twice now. DTW and JFK. Both were fantastic. Premium Economy is very comfortable without being horribly expensive. The entertainment choices are extensive. Air France radio is especially great. The food and drinks are superb. But the especial touch is the staff who are incredibly friendly and helpful. It is the only airline I wish to fly to France.","2018-08-03"
"4","Very efficient.","Arrived at Warsaw and looked at long lines at the desk.  No baggage so very pleased to find we could self obtain our boarding passes SA information lots of time. A few problems with some passengers but on e boarding started was relatively quick. Changed planes in Paris with no problems. The crew were very personable and the snacks on both flights were very good. Will definitely use again if we can ","2018-08-03"
"2","Loss baggage","Horrible company.  They didn't put our luggage on the connecting flight from Paris to Rome.  Took 1.5 days to get 2 bags and 2.5 days to get the third.  Almost a month later and still haven't gotten reimbursed for items we had to buy.  Their customer service is horrible and won't respond.  They just don't care about their customers.  All they care about is their paycheck.","2018-08-03"
"1","Avoid Air France","I have been flying Air France for almost 10 years, and somehow they lost of my miles so I'm still at the lowest level of fidelity while my mother is at gold and my father platinum. On this flight, my luggage got lost (stolen) in Paris due to a short layover. The airport is not organized, the Air France staff are rude, they overbook most of the flights, their land service is terrible, the in-flight service is terrible. For traveling sky priority or not, everyone deserves respect. Air France lacks respect to a minus disturbing level.","2018-08-03"
"3","We got bumped off our return flight even paid for 5 months in advance!","Air France gave us 1 day notice of their overbooking and kicked us out on the next day's flight despite we purchased and paid 5 months in advance.   We had to scramble for last minute to extend hotel stay and ruined the plan to be home in time for work commitment.  They didn't offer for compensation for their mistake of overbooking.   We had to find their partner to fly home on time but took whole day with all the connections instead of original non-stop flight.  I feel that they should change their policy to remove customers based on dates of purchase when overbooking instead of picking random names to remove.

Up to this date there is no apology about their overbooking despite my written to them,  I will never fly air france again.","2018-08-02"
"3","Avoid air france","If you book a flight with delta, you could travelling in an air france flight.
Avoid air france, they have flight delays, technical issues, labor strikes etc. Anything but flying on time. On top of that tired flyer like me was subjected to a prejudiced chubby air hostess.","2018-08-02"
"3","Air France","The Good: Air France premium economy was worth the upgrade and price!!! The leg room is much better and the seat is bigger.  Get on the sides where there are only two seats together, good area!  In flight service was good, however, they only spoke French on the intercom so we never understand the announcements, glad it wasn't an emergency!
The BAD: Charles deGaulle airport, NIGHTMARE! Seriously, allow 4 hrs to get checked in and thru passport control and security. We allowed 3 hrs and barely made our flight, which was delayed 20 minutes, thank goodness. We did not even get to go to the bathroom before boarding, that's how close it was. The sky priority status, which you get with the premium economy upgrade was fantastic in Houston, horrible in Paris. With approximately 20 people in front of us in line and it took 1 hr and 15 minutes to just check our bags. There were only two people checking bags and they did NOT get in any hurry to speed things up AND the baggage conveyor was broke. So, you had to check your bag at the counter then get them all back and take them to another area, not good. Then on to passport control, again, with sky priority line. That took over an hour to get thru, only two control officers for the entire line, which we where in the priority line. If we were in the general line, we would have missed our flight. Security was a breeze since passport was so backed up. Again, allow 4 hrs in Paris or be ready to experience great anxiety for possibly missing your flight. Air France did a very poor job at check in at Paris!!!!!!","2018-08-02"
"2","Air France B787-9 Premium economy - Too expensive for the product/service it is","Premium economy in AF is not worth. Too expensive. If you fly Economy Comfort in KLM it is much worth, basically because it just costs 100$ in KLM and the level of comfort (although KLM seats just have more recline and legroom  than in economy) is much higher than in AF that costs a lot more for nothing (separate cabin, same food and not comfortable). Service is the same as in economy and the seats are not comfortable nor you feel rested when you arrive to destination. 

Try KLM economy comfort for a cheaper price... it will be much better and comfortable than AF premium economy !","2018-08-02"
"4","Always consistent","Air France has always provided me a consistent level of service and quality. The flight attendants are attentive and professional. The full flat seats in first/business class on the Boeing 777-300 are OK comfort, been in better flat seats in the same 777-300 airframe. Food was excellent and many choices. Since flying to Saudi Arabia ALL alcohol was collected and sealed 2hrs prior to arrival in Riyadh due to it being illegal in country.","2018-08-02"
"1","Worst call center","I changed a KLM ticket on KLM.com, which purchased on a travel agency website, 
Booking changing from KLM flight to Air France flight one day later was success and I got a written confirmation by e mail.
I tried to make online check in now, my booking was empty on the site. (The original is today and the new flight is tomorrow).
I called Air France customer center, then an operator said, it's impossible to change on KLM.com due to purchased on a travel agency website. 
However, no error messages and I got a confirmation with new flights!
She said ""Call your travel agency, here reservation section, not complaining section. If you have a complain, make it on the Air France website"".
I called the travel agency and they could not touch anymore because the original flight was left already. However, they could see my booking changing action. KLM didn't confirm it, they said. 
Again, I got a confirmation with changing fee, ticket number, booking code. 
I called KLM call center and explained it again. 
The operator asked me to hold and wait. After 5min, she was back and explained same that a travel agency booking was impossible to change on KLM.com, however she could see my changing action. 
Then she told to be able to change flights to tomorrow now on the phone with the same price + EUR15 calling center changing fee.  
 Of course, KLM should fix the such bug on the web, however, the KLM operator was friendly and helped a lot. 
Air France operator was just explaining same excuse and when I said to record our conversation(I did), she laughed and said ""go ahead"".
AF/KLM use same system, then AF operator could see my transaction, however, she didn't say anything just told me to talk with the travel agency.
Air France customer service training is absolutely failed or they don't coach anything for new employees.","2018-08-02"
"1","DONT FLY IF YOU HAVE AN ALLERGY","awful service on board. Every other airline you have to tell when you get on the plane if you have a Nut allergy. Today we did and they shrugged shoulders. I said can you please announce it so people are aware and refrain from eating nuts... to get a reply we can’t. Then a steward comes over Asif we arnt humiliated enough and says so your saying you can’t go to the cinema or anywhere??? ITS AIRBORNE!! Still didn’t understand the severity of if she died in the air they wouldn’t be able to land quick enough. Epi pens only last so long !!!

"5","Great service","We made a trip on air france to Paris then on to Lourdes tarbes airport.

The service was good for such short trips and to make it that much more is that they provide food and drink for free.

My ticket only showed my first and last names not my middle name (all three names are on my passport).  I phoned Air France to confirm that this was okay - they said yes.  I had no issue because I got my boarding pass on line and only had carry on.  My travelling companion had checked luggage and the machine in Montreal would not allow her to process.  Air France should require the same number of names as in the passport.  

Also, at that time Air France was having rotating strikes - so we were worried about strikes.","2018-07-23"

"4","Generous flight crew and great flight overall","We spent a lot of time in the air with Air France this week and have no complaints really. We were in Premium economy which had some advantages - shorter lines, more leg room, closer bathroom access, leg and foot rests. The only drawback of Premium Economy is that the backs of the seats don't recline unlike the do with Economy seats. I'm not able to sleep sitting up, so that part was uncomfortable, but the rest of my family did fine. The meals were the typical airplane fare with a couple of more interesting choices thrown in like a bon bon, extra rolls, nice cheese, and champagne. I look forward to flying with Air France again in the future. ","2018-07-23"

Over and over we called the lost luggage service and requested they send it to our hotel in Barcelona. At first they said ""sure, no problem"" and the bag never showed. We called again and they said they didn't have the bag. 

They called back later and said it was again found and they would send it to our hotel. Another two days and no bag. We called them and they asked us to stop calling. 

Finally, before leaving we called the 1-800 number and got in touch with someone from the U.S. who told us it was on a flight from Paris to Cleveland, OH the next day. Why they couldn't get the bag to us I don't understand. 

Never again will I fly Air France.","2018-07-22"

So we had to add two more hours to our overnight flight before we could reach our final destination Aveignon and get to rest. So after the two hour delay we proceed to board on to basically an over book flight. Elbow to elbow; screaming kids; no leg room and so on. Fortunately it was only a hour and fifteen minute flight. However, when we landed in Marseille there was some sort of issue with the baggage claim which too another hour to resolve. Are we having fun yet!!!","2018-07-22"
"2","Unfriendly service at Charles de Gaulle desk stewards","We get it, delays happen all the time. But how the service personnel reacts makes or breaks the deal.  The flight crew themselves was very nice but after finding out that 50 people on our plane fr JFK was going to miss their 7 am connecting to Athens, they should have organized a better disembarking process for these 50 passengers.  I have seen this happen in either Korean Air of JAL. Also, almost all of the 50 got on the 9:45 am flight to Athens and we had to wait for the 12 noon flight.  Why did the 7 am not wait for it's 50 passengers?  Airport was hot, crowded and smelly.  We were offered 11 EU each for breakfast.  But that delay cost us half a day which was the longest time we had in Athens btw.  While waiting at the airport, we emailed Air France that was July 5 and up to now still no response.  Can they give me back 6 hours of my life plus that Athens experience we should have had???","2018-07-22"

The problem with this airline is that there seems to be nobody that is able to deliver reliable information to the clients. I got a new flight from Paris and had to switch airports. But my luggage got lost on the way. Now nobody is able to tell me where my bag is. And nobody nests to really help.at air France everybody just delivers excuses or passes me on to another person. Reaching them by phone is nearly impossible. I feel really helpless. This is not the first time we had issues with air France and it's always the same. No customers service at all and people are very unfriendly. I recommend avoiding this airline if you can.","2018-07-22"

"1","Lost/delayed baggage by Air France","Worst experience one can have from Delta and its partner airline Air France as a Diamond Medallion member travelling in Business class.  I am on a trip to India with family and had 5 checked baggage and not a single bag has arrived.  This is second time in a span of three months that I am having a similar experience with Delta and Air France.  It’s been more than three days and they have failed in locating the baggage.  If this is what happens to baggage’s with premium tags, one could wonder what could happen to regular baggage. Customer care service with Delta and Air France are the worse as they fail to give you any update.  Apparently, there is some kind of strike by the employs of Air France and they are not able to care for baggage’s or give a proper update.  If you are travelling on Delta or Air France and via Paris travel at your own risk.","2018-07-21"

"4","Great value and I got a laugh","The plane was lovely, the staff where lovely, the snack was lovely and the flight was extremely good value. We did get a really good laugh though, cause I had booked a window seat at the back of the plane and the back row doesnt have windows, hehehehe, so I had windowless window seat.","2018-07-12"
"5","Great value","Got a good deal, better than the cheap economy airlines.  First time flying AF and I was surprised at how nice it was.  The plane itself was nothing spectacular but I had sufficient leg room and service was professional.  Maybe because I’m from Canada so I’m used to the seriously deficient Air Canada, but a tasty meal, free booze and toys for the kids was more than I was expecting.  I will definitely fly AF again!!!","2018-07-12"

"3","Long flight","Long flight in old airplane. Cabin crew were very nice and professional. No USB, DVD display old small type very difficult to use and to see something. Food was good enough. Air France should consider in using newer airplanes for this kind of long trips.","2018-07-12"
"3","Average, just average","Flight from Edinburgh to Paris (05.55 am) took off spot on time and arrived slightly early into Charles DeGaulle.  Flight had a few empty seats towards front of aircraft (A320) so I had no one sitting next to me, nice when it happens.  Offered croissant and drink.  As a Platinum member of Flying Blue there was no  welcome, not even a generic comment like on KLM that they especially welcome their elite members.  Flight from Charles DeGaulle to Ljubljana (operated by Hop, Embraer 190), was delayed by about 50 minutes due to waiting for the captain to arrive from somewhere, so we were about 40 minutes late arriving.  Sandwich (choice of vegetarian or salmon) and drink offered.
They got us there, fortunately neither Air France or airport staff were on strike.  Enough said.","2018-07-12"
"5","Great short-distance flight ","My wife, little son and I flew with Air France from Munich to Paris. For a premium airline Air France often offers a great value for money ratio. As mentioned before, we travelled with our little son, but the seats in the front row where already fully booked. However, also the seats in back rows offer sufficient space.
Also the flight itself was convient and the flight crew was nice and courteous. Even it was just a short-distance flight snacks and beverages were included in the flight price.
All in all our flight was satisfactorily and we will definitely consider Air France for our next flights, too.","2018-07-12"
"1","delays and disappointment","Had the misfortune to use Air France for my Easter trip to Vietnam.  The outward flights were cancelled with 24 hours’ notice.  Air France were no help whatsoever and were completely uncontactable.  Fortunately, our travel agent stepped up and sorted new flights (huge thanks to Robby at e-mailflights.com).  The return trip was worse.  We were stranded at Guangzhou as they cancelled more flights.  Absolutely no-one from Air France came to see any of the many stranded passengers; they did not offer information about what was happening or what our rights were, nor provide any kind of refreshment.  We were herded around the airport for six hours before alternative flights were found.  I have had several e-mail conversations with them, but have been fobbed off with half truths about the weather – bad weather in Asia, bad weather in Paris, another strike have all been given as reasons for the cancellation by different members of AF staff.  Their absolute refusal to take any kind of responsibility for their very poor treatment of all the passengers that were stranded is not a great advert for their service nor does it inspire trust to make future bookings.","2018-07-12"
"4","Very good flight; very bad ground staff at CDG","Our experience of Air France business class was very good - good aircraft, very comfortable seats, good in-flight service, good wines and food. 
The negative is all on the ground - I have less problem with the fact that CDG is not really a pleasant or well designed airport (neither is Frankfurt); but the real issue is the absolute rudeness of the ground staff at CDG - they are the reason that I try to avoid flying Air France","2018-07-11"

"4","Surprised to the level of service","Really was pleasantly surprised at the quality of service on the flight.  The staff were helpful and friendly and managed the flight well.

Nothing exceptional to mention, just a good standard flight on a well looked after plane.","2018-07-11"
"3","Professional, clean flights","we chose to fly this international flight via Premium Economy and were mostly pleased with our choice. SEATS: wider and more leg room (2-3-2), but no incline back- very uncomfortable if you want to sleep the whole flight. There were a couple people who ended up on the floor on their blankets. But, the increased space was worth the price compared to the sardine section. FOOD: basically the same as economy, with a different ""appetizer"" & desert on the plate and better napkins. Food from SFO was terrible airplane fare- luckily we brought our own salad/veggies too. SERVICE: not ywarm & fuzzy, but professional. plane was clean and new. SECURITY:  even with the preferred security, it was a hellacious maze through and we barely made the flight- even with 2 1/2 pre-arrival time. From De Gaulle:  as it was a day fight, it was much more comfortable and a very painless trip back to SFO. FOOD: better on the return flight from Paris. The check-in process at De Gaulle with AF was a nightmare- several long lines and waits, rerouting, even with precheck- unbelievably disorganized. 3 hours pre-arrival and we again barely made it on the flight in time. Otherwise, it was a good and efficient flight and we were satisfied.","2018-07-11"
"5","Great flights","I want to thank AirFrance’s crew for creating such a good experience for me and my two girls. We flew from Tel Aviv to Paris and from Paris to Buenos Aires. Both fights were better than expected. Actually the long-haul flight was the best I ever experienced!

Decent seats, nice meals, warm crew, the toilets were always clean, every thing worked just fine. 

Great job and not at all obvious. 
","2018-07-11"
"5","Hassle free flight","The flight was cheap. The check in was done for us automatically and we were seated next to each other. We were not asked to pay extra for anything although there was an option to purchase extra service.  For a cheap flight they offered light snack which was quite nice.  The legroom was big and the seats were comfortable.  The only complaint I have was that my daughter needed to purchase an extra luggage.  The mobile app was not allowing her to purchase the extra luggage so she phoned the london customer service.  The man she spoke with suggested just purchasing the extra luggage at the airport because it is the same price as it is on the app.  When we got to the airport it was the regular extra luggage price which was triple the price it was on the app.  She had no choice but to pay the amount.  The staff were not so friendly as well but they were not rude.  I suppose I can say that they were there to do a job and that was it","2018-07-11"
"5","MY FAVORITE AIRLINE WHEN FLYING INTERNATIONAL","I've flown Air France several times and I just adore this airline, the food, and the service. I think my favorite thing is really love the food, the movie selection and the freedom to move around the cabin and help yourself to beverages. I love it.","2018-07-11"
"2","OK IN THE AIR (JUST) - BUT GROUND SERVICE APPALLING","Air France seems to have adopted a process whereby people buying cheaper tickets are ""penalised"" by only being allowed to board the plane last - i e after other (higher-paying) passengers have boarded.
Frankly it doesn't bother me if other folk see I have paid less - more power to my elbow !!
But the policy - if that's what it is - is frankly disastrous. People boarding according to ticket price means that the aisles get jammed with folk putting luggage in the overhead bins and generally getting themselves settled, while the next group is loaded. The result is huge traffic jams in the aisles with a knock on effect of ever-growing numbers of frustrated passengers in never-ending queues in the departure hall. In our case the queues stretched into an adjoining departure area, with no-one really knowning what was what or where they should be standing.
Since most folk can't get to their seats without pushing past earlier boarders the plane ends up incapable of taking off in time with resultant fruistration to everyone
Tio describe the boarding process as a shambles is an understatement. It was just as bad on an earlier flight Paris - Toronto so the procedure doesn't seem to have been an exception. And, of course, CdG Airport in Paris had to be navigated in each instance which is an exercise in frustration itself
Although the flight was smooth and the flight attendants reasonably attentive, the food was abysmal. Also, the aircraft for our flight seemed to be well past sell-by date - the TV screens should have been supplied with special magnifying glasses they were so small. 
Overall not great - we will not be repeating the experience","2018-07-11"
"1","AWFUL EXPERIENCE","Air France has gone down the toilet in the past 10 years.  What was a stellar airline in now in the sewer.  Flying long haul flights with them is no different than on a low cost domestic carrier.   The check in was over 90 minutes at JFK and the staff seemed nonchalant about the wait.  Staff was underwhelming at the counter.  The plane itself is uncomfortable seats and tight, tight space in economy.  The entertainment is ok but nothing special.  The staff was fair, nothing like they used to be.  The only good thing I can say is the food was good for airline food.  The best of any airline I've traveled with.  However, that is not enough for me to travel with Air France.  They have lost a customer with me.  I will look to other options for my next international flight.  It's a shame.  They were once the best in the market.","2018-07-11"

"1","Seats were uncomfortable, and my bags were lost for a second time.","The flying experience with Air France was not especially terrible, but their business class seats are of much lesser quality than any other airline I have flown. The seats do not recline all the way, but leave you at an odd angle. Most likely in order to save space so they can squeeze more money out of each flight. Our flight was delayed due to ""technical difficulties"" the existence of which were only announced to us after an hour and a half of waiting at the gate. The few announcements were also unhelpful and difficult to understand. After a difficult flight that was meant to be seven hours but ended up at around nine hours including wait time at the gates on both ends, they lost our bags. This is the second time I have flown Air France, and also the second time they have lost my bag. The information on our bags was all correct, with the proper flight number and destination. Clearly they are very lax in making sure all the bags are on the flight. This will be the last time I ever fly Air France.","2018-07-03"
"3","Efficient but impersonal","The  check in was very slow and congested at Dublin airport - a 2 hour wait in the queue. Once on board both the Dublin - Paris, and the Paris - Johannesburg, the cabin crew were efficient, but really not overly concerned with the passengers. The demeanor came over as cold - getting the job done, but with no extra charm, help or friendliness.","2018-07-03"
"3","Poor service","The price is business price but service is third class.
Low-cost quality of food
No welcoming, No attention.
They do what they must that' s all.

Not at all what is expected ( and it Seems than in others classes it is worst)","2018-07-03"
"3","Frustrating Until You Are On The Plane","The frustration starts when you try to use the kiosk to get boarding passes and baggage tags. If you do not have baggage I assume everything is fine, but if you need to check-in bags then the nightmare begins. The kiosk will send you to the line at the ticket counter. Multiple lines form but no one can tell you which one you should be in. If you tell them you are going to miss the flight they tell you not to worry because it will be delayed. Once you finish with that ordeal, then everything will be fine. The flight attendants were nice and the seats were ok. It is a short flight. If you are on a longer flight be ware of the non-reclining tight seats.","2018-07-03"
"5","Typical french flare","The A380 is a massive airplane and it takes a long time to board it, the storage space is limitted so try to avoid a large carry on if you are in Zone 4 you may find it hard to find a space. On the upper deck there is more space, on the lower deck it feels very crowded. There are a lot of air crew so service is good","2018-07-02"
"4","Change is good","Almost a nightmare but thanks to Air France it ended well.
Was booked on Delta to leave at 9.30am but went to check in 24hrs beforehand and saw flight details was changed to leave at 11.30 instead. Delta did not inform me of any changes. 
Had to complain then I was booked on the Air France flight via Paris .
Delta is now one of the worst airlines they just don’t care about their customers.
What has happened to our rights as customers ?","2018-07-02"
"5","Great service and great food","We flew this because I wanted to fly the A380. We paid a little bit more to pick our seats upstairs. The service was amazing, and we loved the food served on the flight. Will definitely try to fly this airline and type of aircraft again!","2018-07-02"
"2","Poor subsidiary airlines","I had to change two airlines, to reach my hometown. From Inverness to Amsterdam was KLM and it has been the most fantastic experience ever. But, further on JET Airways comes in and everything becomes messier from there on. I got pissed on AIR France because, they did not take any responsibility for any mistakes by JET Airways, even though I booked my flight via AIR France.","2018-07-02"
"1","Long delays, even cancellations eem to be more common than with other airlines","A general comment about Air France.  I have found it fine once I take off, but quite frequent long delays and a cancellation that forced me to cancel a short holiday one Thanksgiving makes me very wary about taking Air France.  Although the experience on board might be slightly better than on United, the latter has a much better ontime record.

I find it quite unreliable.","2018-07-02"
"1","Extremely disappointed","Upon check in we found out premium economy overbooked.  My husband took the small cramped coach  seat.  We didn’t pay that much to not get what we paid for.  Wish we had been notified in time to rebook or change flights.  We were told a family with 3 children needed to sit together.  There were no children in premium economy.  Extremely disappointed.","2018-07-02"
"3","Service needs work","The plane layout was fine. I especially liked the large lavatory. While the personnel were friendly I thought the service was lacking. I had to ask for water when in most other carriers it would have been passed around multiple times. In general it did not feel like the Business Class I am used to.","2018-07-02"
"4","Surprisingly OK","The flight pretty much uneventful. We wouldn’t ordinarily fly AF but had no choice. ( KLM much better!) The seating and entertainment good. Food average. 11-1/2 hours flight! The crew were friendly save one gentleman on the return flight. The in-flight snacks pretty sparse.","2018-07-02"
"3","Family trip to Lebanon","Traveling with 4 kids to Lebanon is not a walk in the park. Despite our efforts to pack activities and potential needs for the kids, the flight to Beirut was rough. I usually use Emirates but wanted to save travel time, therefore, Air France had the shortest travel time. The service was definitely not the same as Emirates, the attentiveness was lacking, and now I would have been better off traveling on an American airline instead, if Emirates or Itihad not an option. Another issue to keep in mind that I did not know is that despite not leaving the airport in Paris, we had to go through security again!!!!","2018-07-02"
"1","Delays, confusion, delays ... and no method to manage flyer expectations","From long, unmoving lines, bullying desk agents, flight attendants flying out of US airports who can’t clearly communicate in English, and staff members who push passengers out of the way rather than simply wait one more second (non-emergency pass-throughs), our experience in flying Air France out of Dulles (IAD / Washington DC) was unnecessarily stressful and disappointing.

We checked in via email and were told we had to be there extra early because Air France wanted to ensure on-time departure.  Instead, Air France (AF) was late in getting the airplane cleaned (a seemingly standard event for AF), late in loading the crew, late in getting passengers boarded—and yet they had neither working status board nor the desire to keep people informed as to changing departure time.  

When they did start to load, they had what appeared to be the most bizarre process we’ve witnessed in a long time:  loading was by zones—but with several ‘same zone’ placards in different areas of the loading gate just adding to the confusion of where to stand—with multiple assistants manning the lines making everything even more confusing.  And since Air France started the boarding process before the plane was available, many passengers just snaked along the airplane jet-ways without being able to board.  What's the point?

It took forever to load because of the disorganized process (a style which is only available, in our experience, on Air France); we were quite late in leaving, jeopardizing our connecting flight in Paris but that possibility didn’t bother the Air France folks who seemed more automaton than human. There was sparse communication between the Air France employees and the passengers and when there were announcements, the English spoken was so weighed down with heavy accents that the words were often unintelligible.  Had there been a true emergency, many people would have needlessly been put in danger simply because of a language barrier.

We reversed our problems when we landed.  We arrived at the gate—and spent almost 45 minutes standing in the aisle and not moving toward the exit for reasons known only to Air France:  no one explained what the hold-up was so we stood and waited as the time between connections continued to narrow.  (This appears to be a Charles De Gaulle / Air France feature, because when we returned to Dulles on the same model of plane, also completely full, also operated by Air France, we were able to begin exiting within ten minutes.  Only country of touchdown truly provided a reasonable context for efficiency and lack thereof.)

If you know Charles De Gaulle Airport you know it can be difficult to navigate.  We were going from Terminal 2E, Hall M, to Terminal 2D—almost on the opposite end of the shuttle loop.  When we stepped off the plane there was not a single Air France member at the gate to tell us the best way to get between terminals to make our connection (and we were late because of Air France issues!).  There were no boards adjacent to the gate to indicate which departure gate we needed to get to.  There were no immediate signs pointing the direction to 2D.  All we could do was follow the passengers in front of us and hope they knew what they were doing. 

And while this is really a ding against Charles De Gaulle Airport, the way Air France lands its planes seem to be bizarre—often landing at some far distant hall and requiring passengers to walk off the jet-ways and on to busses to head off to someplace far distant from where you land—and then you have to figure out how to get back to where ever you need to go.  It is not a fun or efficient process.

We were running, we were sweating, we were upset and we were angry when we finally got to our departure gate—only to find out it was going to be significantly delayed even though the status board continued to indicate on-time departure.  This isn’t the first time this has happened to us with Air France flights: communication just isn't their thing, it seems.  What does seem to be their goal is to cram as many people into planes as possible and then put them into a series of stressful situations while providing them with as little information as they can and minimal service--perhaps it is a corporate culture thing at play, but this same 'environment' has happened with every single Air France flight I have taken in 20 years (I have learned to avoid the airlines if at all possible.)

As for the plane—it was a big, double-decker one with every seat was filled—but there were insufficient bathrooms, confusing signals from the staff as to which bathrooms were available to which groups, and a significant language barrier when it came to official announcements.

Our flight back was equally as disruptive. Our Air France co-share European flight arrived at Charles De Gaulle terminal F, using to jet-ways to leave the plane—but we were then forced to exit the jet-way to get crammed like sardines into big buses to be moved across the airport to get to our actual arrival gate of record—and go through passport control again, even though we were traveling within the Schengen countries.  Then it was back out of the terminal and back on a bus that took us and dozens of our new best friends careening around the airport again.  We raced once more to our departure gate, arriving just as boarding was being started—but, alas, Air France announced they were delaying our departure by two hours:  even though the plane was at the gate, fully empty, Air France needed well over two hours to clean and restock (instead of just calling in additional cleaning staff, AF seems more content to make hundreds of passengers wait).  The cleaning situation seems a consistent con job--the planes are at the gate and passengers are queuing but Air France just can't seem to manage to get the plane cleaned up and ready on time. Two hours came and went and still we waited.  In the meantime, Air France staff members walked among the queuing crowds and select some parents with small kids (not all) and some older people (though not all) and brought them to the front of the line.  Where they also waited.  No announcement was made.  The status board varied between ‘ boarding’  and ‘boarding delayed’ and back again. 

We started to load almost three hours later.  By now, everyone should have been in the waiting area and ready to board the plane or be left behind.  Oh, no.  A nearly fully loaded plane with passengers who were already three hours late had to wait while a group of gigging young female adults slowly and unapologetically trickled in--and the Air France attendants made no effort to get these folks seated for departure.  They allowed them to stand in the aisle, switch seats, giggle.  Seriously, folks, what sort of sense does it make to force over two hundred passengers to wait on the tarmac because a few people thought it would be fun to hold the rest of us hostages as they had they merry time in the airport? Yes, it’s a pain to pull off luggage but how long should an airlines wait?  When does the good of the VAST majority outweigh the needs of five people?  And once they were on the plane, couldn't the staff actually do their job and make these girls sit down so we could depart?

This entire exercise with Air France only re-enforced our earlier experiences that taking this airline, especially to Charles De Gaulle, is a huge mistake.  We will work diligently to never repeat.","2018-07-02"

"4","Business class is not what is used to be","This flight was on a gigantic airbus that supposedly held nearly 500 passengers. Check in was delayed in Johannesburg because of problems with the luggage belt. After fighting through the crowds at security and then immigration, I spent a brief period at the SLOW lounge. This is a decent lounge with an excellent selection of food and South African wines. Waiting to board was somewhat chaotic but eventually we reached our seats. The business class service was very good but not stellar. In contrast to the Emirates where hot towels are frequently provided Air France only does this twice--near the beginning and towards the end of the flight. The food options were very good although cheese course a bit disappointing (crumbly goat cheese and brie). The wine selection was frankly very suboptimal. With so many great wines in recent vintages, a village white Burgundy, decent but not inspiring Pouilly Fume, 2012 petit Bordeaux and a respectable Crozes Hermitage. There was only one toilet for our section so there was intermittently a queue for the bathroom. The video system was excellent especially the high fidelity earphones. The seats on this Airbus do not go completely flat so one sleeps at a slight angle. All in all a very pleasant but far from impressive experience.","2018-07-01"

The flight attendants were kind and helpful. 
The ground service was nice to us also.
We did enjoy a meal and a snack on this flight. We had plenty of leg room and the seats were comfortable. We liked the relaxed approach and welcoming atmosphere of the flight attendants. Made our flight seem very short. 
We really didn't have complaints or things that we liked the least. 
Overall, we arrived ready to enjoy France.","2018-07-01"
"4","Wedding in Portiers","I used to flight with my parents many years ago and had a very good opinion of the airline, it used to be one of the best or the best airline in that time.
On May 31th my husband, daughter and myself after months of planning to go to my husbands oldest daughter wedding in Portiers, France we flight to Paris. It was a nice flight, very good indeed and the flight attendant were very kind and the food was good. 
The only inconvenience we had, and really was a big one as we had all our clothes for the wedding in our suitcases, is that it didn’t arrive, ours and no ones in the flight. 
Arriving in Paris we took the train to Portiers as the wedding was the next day. We had to go very early to buy something clean and descent to assist. Not making long this, our suitcases arrived to the hotel in Paris we had made reservations but five days after we arrived to France.
By what we know is that the suitcases of all the flight were never put in the plane even if we left 45 minutes after the hour it supposed to go.
I think this is more a problem of the airport than of the airline, but Air France or any other airline has to have more control of that.
I ask Air France to respond to the inconvenience and the expenses we had to do due this.

"4","Sincere effort to serve and please","The checkin in Houston was fast and smooth with keen interest in serving.  Howeve, the Air France Houston lounge was modest and crowded with limited food/drink choices. Boarding was also smooth and efficient. I think the back support in the business needs to be enhanced. The flight to Paris included dinner and breakfast.  The dinner. Choices were fine. However, two out of three breakfast main courses included pork, which l do not eat.  Again, healthy drink choices absent and if you do not drink alcoholic drinks like me then your choices are limited.
I had a long connection in Paris which l spent in the lounge.  The problem was going through security twice even though l was already checked when l boarded in Houston. So, with logical thinking airport authority and passengers could save a lot of useless time and effort.
The lounge in Gate M was very comfortable with excellent choices of appetizers, food and drink items.  
The flight to Cairo was smooth and the service was acceptable.  The meal included a very tasty veal but with some unwanted fatty parts.
The stewardess seemed to be inexperienced even though very nice. She neglected serving coffe with the desert and took her a long time to respond to my call...too little too late.
Otherwise the flight was good in general.","2018-06-23"
"2","Created Chaos for our large group travel","I was leading a university alumni trip. Air France cancelled our Paris to Detroit flight at the end or our trip for operational reasons. They took 3.5 hours to get us a hotel after cancelling the flight. The hotel they put us in had an extremely over packed shuttle to bring us to our flight the next morning but the shuttle timing left making the flight very close but Air France would not offer to send an earlier shuttle or get taxis to ensure we had enough time. We would have had to pay for our own transport.
When getting to Munich (which they rerouted us to) we were informed Air France had not actually booked our flight to get us back to Detroit. Delta then scrambled, held up a plane, and got most of our group home. In the end we had to split the group into three different planes to get home and this was only possible thanks to Delta.  Upon returning about half our group's bags did not arrive. I definitely can not risk traveling with Air France again.","2018-06-23"

I had to find alternative flights and after 4 hours of talking to Air France we had new flights with layovers. Then we arrived at the airport and our newly booked flight was delayed so we missed our connection and had to go book another flight! Horrible customer service. Then 30 hours before our return flight they canceled our direct flight again!!! It only took 3 hours this time to find new flights with a layover. I will never fly with them again !! Beware of this airline with no consideration for its customers !!  A waste of time and we received no type of compensation or even a sorry. If I could give a negative number I would!!! ","2018-06-23"
"1","Broken entertainment no alternative solutions","14 hr flight on premium economy with entertainment system broken.

There is no alternative solutions provided and they conveniently said flight was fully booked and no upgrades. 

Recently their CEO resigned due to strong union and share price dropped. So u can also forget about complaints directed to the CEO too. 

If they have a negative number, that would be the rating given. Complaint also lodged with CASE. One of the worst airlines ever next to Scoot. ","2018-06-23"
"4","I will repeat a trip with Air France","Long trip but good enough. Free food and drink available during the trip. Very clean restrooms all the time (the most surprising for me). Kind and helpful crew.","2018-06-23"
"4","Pleasantly surprised","Priority check-in, priority boarding, and priority tagged luggage are always a plus. Seats are located in a small separate cabin behind business class on the Boeing 777. Larger than economy seats, they are wider with more leg room, a deeper recline, and extra storage. Each seat is set in its own hard shell case, so when reclining, moves forward rather than back. Hence, the seat in front does not intrude in the space of the seat behind. A foot rest springs up for you to get totally comfortable to watch the large inflight entertainment system. A choice of a decent meal is served from the menu, followed by a selection of drinks. 
Is it worth usually double the cost of economy? Well, I’m not too sure to be honest. I mean, it is nice, and has quite a few valid points. But will I travel Premium Economy again? Yes, definitely. Will it become my preferred class of travel? Probably not. ","2018-06-23"
"1","Horrible customer service","We flew Air France to Europe from Canada for our first trip with our infant. Right from the time we booked the customer service has been atrocious. Called after booking to add our infant onto our ticket, call centre was very difficult to get through, was given varying information by different service reps as to cost of adding infant. 2 wwwks before departure our direct flight was cancelled by the air line and we were put on another flight that involved a connection and arriving 5 hours late and having to reschilde another connecting flight we had with a different airline. Air France check in reps at CDG airport were so concerned about our stroller not being a ‘yoyo’ (yet our stroller, the nano, has the same measurements as the Yoyo). NEWS FLASH AIR FRANCE, not everyone has to have one specific brand of stroller to be cabin compatible. Educate your staff on infant equipment a bit better would you. We also couldn’t check in online because we had an infant????? Never had this problem with any other airline but this happened on all 6 Air France flights. Resulted in us almost being put on stand by because we couldn’t check in and they overbooked their flight.. NEVER FLYING THIS AIRLINE AGAIN","2018-06-23"
"5","My new favorite airline and plane","We paid extra for bulkhead seats on the upper deck of the Airbus 380.  Worth every dollar!  This was the most comfortable flight I have had to Europe.  The flight attendants were courteous and attentive to the passengers' needs.  They had an ice bucket and various non-alcoholic drinks available to us throughout the flight back in the galley.  I would definitely recommend the upper deck as it is not as crowded as the lower and buy your tickets as far in advance as you can.  Love Air France!","2018-06-22"

"2","Not so good French food.","A party of 3 flew to Paris on vacation.  The flight there was on Delta.  Good service and good food.  The flight back was on Air France.  The flight attendants were good, but the food was almost terrible.  I simply could not believe that Air France would serve the quality of food to business class.  It was just no very good.  We'd have been better off with a baguette sandwich picked up from one of the food vendors at the airport.  Shame on Air France given that France is known for its food.
If business class food was barely edible, I cannot imagine what the food was like in economy.","2018-06-22"
"2","Air France","We have to pay extra for legroom. My 1st time using Air France to go to Europe. Food is mediocre. Dinner and breakfast was blah. I expected great food. Connecting flight to Athens from Paris is horrible, it was cold and you are outside the elements, the only good side to it was, it was not raining. Choose other airlines than this one.","2018-06-22"
"2","Bad Airline","On our flight to Paris (connecting to Rome) the entertainment system did not work at all for the whole flight. We paid extra to fly AirFrance over other airlines because they are a big name Airline. The plane both going to CDG and coming home a week later from CDG were absolutely disgusting. The plane's are dirty and old which is quite gross. It seems that the flight attendants did a poor job from the flight prior because my seat had crumbs all over it, inside the seat back pocket, and most of all, between my seat and the window. Absolutely gross. ","2018-06-22"
"4","Good first experience","Booked this flight as I did not want the hassle of connecting to the Eurostar, and was quite pleased they lived up to the hype. Got my onward boarding pass from an excellent transfer desk officer, and flight was quite comfortable in these new seats that have USB charging points. Complementary snack and beverage on this flight were more than sufficient for this short journey, and staff were warm and friendly. Minus points: the boarding process was slightly chaotic and not very well-executed, and the flight was delayed due to the electronic gates being unable to work properly. Would definitely recommend for short transfers.","2018-06-22"
"5","A short but pretty trip to Bilbao!","This was a great trip to Bilbao.  Not a long trip, however the flight crew were very understanding about our excess luggage (not a lot) and warned us of other internal flights wanting to charge us.  It was a short flight, but so picturesque! It was a beautiful day and we arrived in Bilbao about midday & the sky was so blue.  Flying into the city of Bilbao was stunning.","2018-06-22"
"1","Always unpleasant experience","I got the flight because I run out of time and other airlines were too expensive. I cannot tell never again because I travel too much to France but please now guys this is like a gymkhana of steps. Everyone of them more unpleasant than the previous one.

The outbound flight.
Checking area.
The ground staff organises for its own comfort. In groups of people with or without luggage. At the end there are people that go with luggage by the no-luggage queue. People claim but who cares.
Sitting at the place.
My seat is busy and the crew is peacefully not doing anything. At the end I have to ask to one stewardess to organise it.
Not space for the legs at the airplane.

Fligth back
I cannot do the checking at the website from the mobile phone without chanigng the seat. I check unwanted seat.
At the checking area the automatic machines and few personnel to attend to many people. Queues everywere.
Of course the automatic ticketing machine does not work with my ticket and it indicates I need help.
After getting the ticket fot the luggage there are a lot of automatic machines to load the luggage but nobody helping.
Some machines pretend to work but they do not work.
My flight is delayed. For the moment 15 min.

Pros. The price if you run out of time.
Cons. Everthing else.","2018-06-22"
"5","Great Service and Lounge","A great experience.  I had an easy check in, good food and wine in the airport lounge, a comfortable flight which was on time, and excellent service on the flight.","2018-06-21"
"4","Polite crew, nice service and food choices","We flew Air France from Charlotte to Detroit to Paris to Copenhagen and returned the same route. The domestic flights were on Delta and the others were in AF. While the pre flight service was same on all flights the ofligjt experience itself was different. Delta service was what I had typically experienced on US carriers. Hetbyou from point A to B with minimal services. Nice staff but nothing special from service without extra charges. The standard chips and a soft drink. We found the Air France staff nice as well. On our transatlantic flight we had meal service and were offered pre/during and after dinner drinks with no charge. On our short flight from Paris to Copenhagen we were offered sandwiches and a drink. Overall pleased with the AF service.","2018-06-21"
"5","Very good","Nice new plane. Somewhat full, but able to change seats to a more quiet area of the plane. Very helpful and friendly flight attendants. Had ordered special meal: Allergen free. It actually tasted good! Air France has a slightly narrower seat pitch than KLM, so if you want legroom in abundance, choose KLM on this distance. If you want excellent service, good food and drink, new comfortable seats (they are wider than KLM), choose Air France.","2018-06-13"
"4","Great staff; good economy experience","We flew Air France between Paris and Tokyo on the 21 and 27 of May. We were worried our flight might've end up cancelled due to a series of strikes that had been going on for a few months, luckily we were unaffected.

As we had arrived from an earlier flight with HOP!, their regional affiliate, we were already fully checked in from our origin airport, Bilbao. Transiting between terminal 2G, HOP!'s own terminal on the other side of CDG, and Terminal 2E, where our flight departed from, was straightfoward, however do expect some queues for security. After security you take a shuttle bus to your terminal - there's a few of them so make sure you catch the right one!

Once you arrive at Terminal 2E there's not much else but to relax, the terminal's a bit like a swanky shopping mall in the center, featuring tons of luxurious brands I can't afford.

Boarding was somewhat chaotic at first, however the gate staff managed to properly divide everyone by groups. (A similar experience was had at Narita.) We'd soon arrive at our seat, a brand new one with proper responsive screens (albeit they were also a bit stiff). We bought special duo seats (2 seats instead of 3, great for couples) at the end of the plane. While our legroom was tight in row 51, the seats behind us had a bit more legroom themselves. However, the plane we flew in, an Boeing 777-300, has various cabin configurations- do take a look at how it's configured via the ""Choose your seat"" section while booking. Perhaps the biggest downside would be the tray tables, they're at a bit of a wonk and don't really slide out that much, we though they were broken however all of them are like that sadly.

Meals consisted of ""dinner"" right after take off (you can choose between a Western or a Japanese meal), breakfast 2 hours before landing, a drink and an ice cream service, and some platters of free snacks and drinks in the galleries at each side of Economy class. Overall the food was very good, not much to complain there.

There were plenty of movies to choose from, lots of Hollywood stuff as well as foreign films. Can't same the same with TV, as it's just mostly sitcoms. You really need to use the crummy headphones provided as the audio that comes out of this thing is dreadful, and it'll only sound good, bizzarely enough, with said phones. For some reason despite being new screens they still use the old clunky UI but it still works. Should also note that, if a movie has Spanish audio on offer, it'll most likely been Latin Spanish rather than European.

Check-in on the way back was again quite fast and easy, you've got a bunch of touch screens up front when you arrive at Terminal 1 (north wing) at Narita, after they've printed out your boarding passes you head over to the desk to drop off your luggage.

Overall Air France, while perhaps nowhere near as magical as it used to be for me many years ago, is still a solid airline, and I'll be glad to use them in the near future.","2018-06-13"
"1","Not a pleasant experience","Just had the unfortunate opportunity to fly Joon Airlines, Air France's sister carrier. I cannot tell you what a let down it was and how uncomfortable the cabin was. I connected to a Joon flight from Paris to Berlin after a wonderful experience on Air France (Business class from Minneapolis to Paris) and Boise to Minneapolis on Delta (First Class.) The Joon flight has to be one of the worst travel experiences of my life. They failed to upgrade me to Business class even though my ticked clearly called for that class of service and to make matters worse the aircraft layout is by far the tightest I have ever experienced not to mention the seats were incredibly uncomfortable. Avoid Joon at all cost and make sure if you are connecting in Paris it is on a main line Air France flight.","2018-06-13"
"1","Worst experience ever","I had to share the horrible experience I had with Air France. As it seems, getting to Miami from Beirut without my luggages, and receiving them only after 8 days, without even being proposed to be paid back for all the new wardrobe I had to get, is the highlight of this experience. This is how the rest goes; on my way back to beirut from Miami international airport, I get to the check-in desk, where they announce me, that the flight going to Paris Charles De Gaule, is delayed for 3 hours, and as a result, I’d have to miss my connecting flight from Paris to Beirut. Like any other airport would do, they booked me a seat on another flight with turkishairlines from Paris to Istanbul (with a layover of 6 hours) then one again, from Istanbul to Beirut. Having no other choice, I send my luggages, on this exact itinerary, and go have a dinner with the voucher they offered me as an excuse for the delay. How generous of them. I get to Charles De Gaule, look at the screens, for the gate of my second flight, except that I don’t find it anywhere. So I go to the information desk, the woman in charge, investigates my case, only to find out, that I got put on the wrong flight, and that I should get instead on the flight going to Istanbul with atlas global, which was boarding in the next 20 minutes. Technically, I had the same itinerary, but different timing and airline, so naturally I ask about my luggages, cause their number tag is different than my final ride, and she assured me that they were taking care of the changes. For now all is good, since I don’t have this long layover anymore, until I get to the airplane, and discover that they had transferred me to a low cost flight... I didn’t pay that huge amount of money, to end up in a half shaped plane with no TV no AC no blanket or pillow... The story ends with me coming back to Beirut again with no luggages,nobody knew where they were and I got them back 3 days later. What did I get from all this inconvenience, is only a 15 dollar voucher to have dinner at the international airport of Miami. So thank you Airfrance, I will rethink twice before flying with you.","2018-06-13"
"1","Mrs","My daughters went to visit relatives to Finland. Flight was delayed 3 hours, they did not even bother to message before we drove to the airport. On the flight no m8vies worked. In Paris Air France staff are really rude and no less they lost 1 luggage so now my daughters have to buy all new clothes from Finland. I will NOT let them use Air France ever again!! We will not even use the return ticket, gonna buy it from someone who knows what they are doing!!","2018-06-13"
"3","Air France always on strike","Flight was ok, but strikes in the airline prevented me to take my connection flight, making me arrive to my destiiny one day later. The Hotel provided was more than one hour away from CDG and service was miserable.","2018-06-13"
"5","Great flight ","Flying from CDG to SIN to go then to Bali I am wheelchair bound and I warmly recommend AIR FRANCE: the staff is wonderful and very helpful on board enabling me to travel alone. Besides the meals are delicious. Very good plane and comfortable. ","2018-06-13"
"4","Great little hop and skip over from CDG to Birmingham","I love air france, bit more room in the seats for the small planes.  Nice snack of a sandwich too and a drink which is a nice bonus.
Flight on time.  CDG isn't my favourite air port but there you go.","2018-06-13"
"4","Excellent and convenient","Very good airline. Seats onboard this A380 were spacious and service was extremely polite and courteous. Boarding was swift and timely. Food served in economy class was pretty good. The only problem is that the cabin could have been a bit cleaner. Transit in CDG can be a bit confusing","2018-06-13"
"3","Disappointing","I've been flying with Air France for over 15 years and these last years, it's been going downhill. The only reason that I keep choosing them is the service. The flight attendants are great, and know how to make you feel special. Other than that, it's not worth spending your money on business class. The cabin is outdated, everything is yellowish, the seats are okay (777), and the food is terrible. The portions are extremely small, and the quality is quite poor. We were served lunch as soon as we took off, and before landing they served us a ""snack"", that's all! It was the saddest thing ever: a tiny tortilla wrap, one small profiterole, and some apricot pastry. It was a 7 hours flight, so by the end, I was really hungry. There are cheaper companies with a better cabin, and better food. I don't know what's going on with AirFrance but they really need to step up their game.","2018-06-13"
"3","Tight economy seats ugh","This was my first time flying Air France and I was literally shocked to see how tight the seats were. Mind you I'm a regular sized woman and was flying next to other women same age and size next to me. We bumped into another one all night long, making it really uncomfortable. On the other hand, in flight entertainment was good (not as user friendly as I have seen in other companies but good enough) and I have never eaten so much on a plane as I have on this one. They even offered ice cream during the flight. Despite all of this, given how uncomfortable the seat was, I will consider flying a different company next time.","2018-06-13"
"4","Tight economy seat but great service.","We purchased economy seats in November for a flight the following May.  The price was excellent!!  Boarding the plane went without any problems and we pre-purchased two seats side by side. There was plenty of overhead room for our carry on luggage.  The seats had enough padding to almost feel comfortable.  Service was great.  The meal and breakfast were delicious!  An apertif, wine with meal, or digestive were offered at no extra charge.  A blanket and ear phones were provided.  There were many choices on the personalized entertainment screen.  However, this was an older style plane and when the person in front of us reclined, we were left with very little space. Since this occurred during the meal, our tray table was literally touching our body. A recommendation to airlines would be to require seat back be in an upright position during landing, take off, AND DURING MEALS. Just that few extra inches would make eating much easier and pleasant to the person behind you.  We landed almost 30 minutes early and as usual when this happens the gate wasn't clear for our landing.  We landed in an outer area, took the steps to the ground, boarded a bus to transport us to the terminal.  So, our early arrival was actually delayed by the time we reached the terminal.  This wasn't the airlines fault, just something that happens frequently at CDG.  Don't book a train or tour without considering that this may happen to you too.","2018-06-12"
"1","Awful","After queuing for over 1 hour and 30 minutes we were greeted by a member of staff of airfrance to electronically check in our baggage. First of all we met all the requirements of the baggage on the flight out so bear this in mind. She goes on to rudely say that our bags are too much, (2 adults, 1 infant, 3 carry on bags (meeting the dimensions of length, width and weight) 1 handbag a plastic bag with souvenirs and 2 small infant backpacks. She explains we would need to pay €180 to place our bags in hold (this was free and a complimentary service offered by airfrance on the flight out from Manchester) yet she wanted us to pay!! I said we meet the requirements, she abruptly stopped me and litterally spat at me saying take your chances with security but I suspect you will be back!! Now clear of security and they are happy with the bags!! 

France in general needs serious education on customer service. If I had of spoken to one of my customers in the manner in which I have been spoken to throughout the course of our holiday I would have been fired!! There is lack of understanding, communication, and respect. Personally we wouldn’t use this airline ever again not if you paid me a million pound!!","2018-06-12"

"5","My current favourite Airline ","Awesome service and flight

My airline of choice by enlarge because the fly the A380 to Johannesburg.

Legroom, on time, ease of transfer, host of connections.

In flight service for the price is the best by far","2018-06-12"
"3","Not the best longhaul airline","The service was not just as good as you can have  in the better companies. The food and drinks could be better. Entertainment was bad","2018-06-12"
"1","WORST EVER","Air France LOST one of our bags for five days, and was extremely uncommunicative about its whereabouts, status, or what they were doing to help find it. We spent hours on hold and spoke with nice but completely unhelpful service reps. We kept having to speak with Delta and KLM reps who had no access to Air France systems. It made zero sense. Aren't they the same company?

It also takes six weeks to be reimbursed for any necessities you have to buy, which is completely outrageous. Literally the worst experience. We will never fly Air France again.

The actual flight experience was just fine. The plane is pretty old and not nice. No legroom. The airline food was actually disgusting- totally inedible, so pack your own snacks. Luckily it was a short flight. The onboard staff was nice. Charles De Gaulle airport is a snow show- unhelpful staff, the most inefficient check in process, and delayed flights. Yerevan airport is super clean and efficient.","2018-06-12"
"4","Not Singapore -- But Good","Let's face it --- sitting in the back in cattle-class in almost every plane is grim. 

Most airlines pack people in, because that's the way they make a profit.  We passengers want to get from A to B the quickest way, so we put our minds in neutral and endure the queues at the security inspections and all the other check-in discomfort before going into the vast shopping mall that separates us confusingly from our plane's departure gate.  That's all part of the profit, too, and it's not the wisest thing to buy anything in these places, because if you do and you think about it later you kick yourself and admit that you could have bought whatever it was for ten Euros less at any shop in your town.

And you try to buy a sandwich, because you think won't get anything on the plane (but wait and read down a bit) and you discover that sandwiches cost approximately the same as a starter at the Ritz.  Then you sit down in the gate waiting area and listen to announcements saying that all sorts of privileged passengers will be welcome to board before you will, and eventually you stagger down the aisle to the airplane and find your seat.

But then, in Air France, there is a nice change.  Sure, the leg-room is lousy and the seats have all the comfort of a pre-shock electric chair --- but the cabin staff are attentive and make you feel welcome.  

The snack served on board is reasonable and makes you regret you paid ten Euros for a carry-on packet of mouse-fodder.

All in all, for modern air travel, the modern equivalent of galley-slavery, Air France is pretty good.","2018-06-12"
"4","Full Flight, Plenty of Overhead Space, Uneventull - No Complaints","This is Air France's standard non-stop flight home from Paris to Los Angeles.
My wife and I learned to pick the aisle and middle seat and count on a small person taking the window.  I made the opposite mistake on an unrelated flight sitting middle and window, and dammit Ray you were half way into my circle of trust.
Unless AF is late due to an aircraft arriving late, they are prompt on boarding and take off. I think Zone 4 is ""Economy"".  Once the others board such as handicapped, child bearing, Super Priority, Extra Priority, and  Regular Priority, then Zone 4 and subs start to board.  It is actually unorganized but everyone gets a seat and there is loads of overhead space so don't panic.
They serve aperitifs and juice etc.  Don't be afraid to ask for Champagne.  Then with dinner or lunch there are the almost acceptable red and white wines.  Then after dinner there are digestives- don't be afraid to ask for the Brandy.  Okay maybe I have a problem but people should know their options.  Near the end of the flight is a snack-meal.  Almost all the foods they serve are carb-forward meaning they want you to go into a sugar coma and be quiet.  The attendants are pleasant.  Mid flight go to the aft and check for little snacks like cookies or dove bars before that darn kid takes two or three of the good ones. 
The seat pitch is acceptable. You probably can't use a full size laptop with the seat down in front of you but the seats did not hit my knees at 6' 1"" (that's 13 stone for the rest of world).
Upon landing LAX seems to have ditched the GOES program and now everyone gets in a long line and everyone checks through at a Kiosk whether or not you have a Global Entry card.
Baggage took forever.  Just when you are about to hit the baggage desk then some more bags come out.   I just realized that if you are the first person to the airport then you are the last person to get your baggage at destination.

I cannot speak as to whether Air France prices are competitive.  I take Air France to France because it has the word France in their name.  Also, they fly Air Bus which I find more comfortable than Boeing.  Don't get me wrong, I am Merican, I own Boeing stock, I used to be employed by Boeing, but Air Bus seems to fly more level.

Lastly, those 10-12 hour flights are difficult for sleeping.  You need one of those disgusting neck pillow things.  They help a little.","2018-06-12"
"4","Professional, helpful staff made for a good experience!","After all the recent strikes, I was nervous for my Air France flight from Warsaw to Paris. I was especially nervous because I was attempting to make a tight connection at Charles de Gaulle in order to catch a flight home to the U.S. after two weeks in Europe. However, I needn't have been so concerned! The online check-in was a cinch. The airline agents at the airport were courteous and professional. Although there was a little wait, they processed checked baggage very efficiently. Boarding was also fairly streamlined. Our takeoff was delayed by 30 minutes due to dense fog and bad weather in Paris. However, the flight attendants and pilots kept us informed of what was happening, and their initial prediction that our takeoff would be pushed back by 20 minutes was a very good estimate. I was very worried about making my connection, but the flight attendant assured me that she would obtain gate information for me before we landed. She followed up with me during the flight, and they announced connecting gates for the other passengers, as well. In the end, we were only about 10 minutes late arriving at our destination gate, and I made my connection. The ongoing labor issues make me hesitant to book future flights on Air France, but otherwise, they are one of my preferred airlines.","2018-06-12"
"3","Certainly not what it used to be!","I used to love Air France back n the day.  Now, not so much.  My first two of three flights were on AF starting in Bucharest, and then from Paris to Atlanta.  The ticket agent insisted that I check my main carry-on even though it was much smaller than almost all of the wheeled luggage I saw people forcing into the overhead bins and it has been with me on many, many trips and absolutely fits in the overhead compartments.  I had to rearrange everything right there and due to that pressure I missed a couple of valuable items.  Fortunately, there were still in my unlocked compartments when I retrieved my bag.  I have not been so lucky in the past with locked, checked luggage on Air France.   The drink service started right behind me three rows behind the bulkhead on the Paris flight, which was about 45 minutes late leaving.  Of course I had not bought anything to drink at the airport.  It took about an extra 30 minutes to get beverage service.  The meal was barely warm and the late snack before landing inedible except for the fruit.  Luke warm coffee which was like mud.  AF used to have the very best food of all the airlines!  I sure cannot say that today.  The restrooms weren't bad, the gate agents organized and the landing perfect.  The seats are pretty tight but fortunately there was an empty seat between my row mate and me on two flights.  Lucky!  I was very worried about the recent multiple strikes they were having but luckily (again) they did not affect me.  I would hesitate to book on AF again because those strikes really can ruin a trip.  Also, I’m not a fan of CDG airport.  The bathrooms are very inconveniently located downstairs and the wait can be really long.","2018-06-05"
"5","Great Airline","I love Air France. It is my favorite airline. There were a few glitches this flight but nothing major. My seat would not recline. Neither the flight attendant or I could get the new “recline without bothering the person behind you” seat to work. Unfortunately my bag stayed in Paris while I proceeded to Houston, but Air France had it delivered. Within 24 hours as promised. I still think Air France deserves 5 star because this is the first time I have ever had an issue.","2018-06-05"
"2","Old and Shabby looking plane","I was surprised at the interior condition of the planes we were on. Arm rests were cracked, seat pocket torn. The food service carts looked like they had landed in Normandy.","2018-06-05"
"1","VERY VERY BAD","Within 10 days while flying to Tel-Aviv from Seattle  and back my luggage was delayed in CDG Paris twice, on my direct flight and back. When came back on Sunday I was assured that my  luggage will be delivered next day Monday to my address. My luggage has arrived at noon on Monday and I received  notification from Air France that it's going to be delivered by 11pm (11 hrs! ) . It has not been delivered, the status has not changed since  that - ""assigning delivery driver"". At 2 AM  text message from Air France woke me up. It says local delivery has tried to contact me and asking me to call a local number. But no one has contacted me, they have my email and phone, no one! I called that local number 206 651-7986 twice, automated prompt says all agents are busy, no one picked the phone. As a result I'm leaving to work tomorrow with the luggage still undelivered along with many critical for me items in it. Second day. Complete uncertainty. Air France service is EXTREMELY BAD. For the Air France reference - claim #SEAAF17393.","2018-06-05"

"4","Great flight crew","I was impressed with the amount of leg room on this flight, and how warm and friendly the flight attendants were. They were most generous with drinks. I ordered a gluten free meal, which was salmon and really delicious. I did have a lot of trouble with the touch screen to watch movies. One of our suitcases was never put on the plane in Paris, but they were able to locate it and it was put on the next flight out that night. The bag was delivered to our home the next morning at 8:30.","2018-06-04"
"1","Rude staff & poor service !!!","The staff are so rude they don’t even look like they want to be at work never mind serve you a drink. 
On a 10 hour flight they come around twice offering drinks. 
They ignore you & the food is rubbish. ","2018-06-04"
"1","Arrogance + Incompetence = Air France","My son was schedule to flight on 4 June from Bologna to Amsterdam at around 1 pm, via Lyon. About 3 hours before the flight he received an sms saying that the Air France flight (operated by Hoop!) was cancelled. They gave a phone number to call - which did not exist!!!!. We went to the airport as instructed by a travel agency. The real nightmare began: KLM had a flight directly to Amsterdam departing at about same time and confirmed they had a place for my son (check in was in the same counter desk!!!). Air France said the ticket had already been transferred to Lufthansa for an evening flight via Frankfurt and refused to revert! I explain my daughter and my three grandchildren were in the KLM direct flight to Amsterdam and it would be wonderful if they could do an effort to accommodate my son in the same flight (remember, place was confirmed by KLM and Air France and KLM are partner companies!). My polite request irritate the Air France ground personnel deeply. They started questioning everything - my son's full name (we are Portuguese, names are usually long), the origin of the ticket, etc, etc. They found nothing wrong, but still refused to help and were extremely rude, demonstrating no sympathy or willingness to support. As I refused to leave, they sent us to Lufthansa desk to ""try and solve the problem"". We went there just to be equally frustrated: Lufthansa sent us back to Air France. I will never understand why Air France decided to endorse their ticket to the evening flight of Lufthansa without consulting the passenger, and refused to revert to a much more convenient flight upon our request, even when proved that place was available!  Totally frustrated, we returned home and 6 hours later we came back again to the airport, just to realize that the Lufthansa flight was delayed and my son got stranded in Frankfurt airport overnight. All because the total incompetence of Air France ground staff in Bologna, associated with a degree of arrogance and discriminatory actions never seen in my 58 years of life. Air France? Avoid by all means, and beware of Air France ground staff in Bologna. You will be insulted if questioning, and definitely not helped even if you beg.","2018-06-04"
"2","Long delays, no communication, damaged luggage","4-hour delay; gates changed without any sort of notice (no announcement on PA, no text, or email); passengers crowded around the gate without any kind of organization.  On the positive, the food was pretty good, and so were the free movies.  But the more important issues to me are timeliness and customer service.  Both were lacking.","2018-06-04"
"2","Delivered Baggage at Midnight","On our flight from Paris to SFO, about 1/2 of the passengers luggage did not arrive.  That meant that after 12 hours of travel, we had to stand in line for an hour and a half at SFO to fill out paperwork on where AirFrance could deliver our luggage when it arrived.  After waiting four days for the luggage to be flown back from Paris, AIrFrance thought it was necessary to deliver our luggage at MIDNIGHT.  I (a women) was alone in the house and had to open the door to a stranger in the middle of the night to sign for the luggage.  NOT HAPPY.  The driver did leave a message on my phone (at 11:15 pm), however, since I was asleep, I did not get it and thus had no idea that the luggage was coming. UNACCEPTABLE.  Check in procedure in Rome was also very chaotic and disorganized.","2018-06-04"

We got lunch and during the fly you want something mor to drink. We got the information that the water get empty and it is not possible to take much we want.
The portiosn of linch was not. so big and taste was not the best. All over service of csbine personal wasn‘t the est. I don‘t want fly anymore with air franc","2018-06-04"
"2","Very disappointed","It has been awhile since we have flown AF. AF resumed their SEA-CDG service recently and we were looking forward to this flight rather than the Dreaded Delta. Baggage check in was flawless, but once at the gate the experience changed for the worst. Boarding was chaos.
   The preflight drink was served after a long delay and then immediately picked up for take off. Why bother? In flight service was slow and very unfriendly. AF is having labor issues and the crew displayed how unhappy they were. The menu was quite interesting but was horribly overcooked. After the meal there was no effort to pick up trays and plates until the crew was good and ready.
   During the flight it was nearly impossible to get water unless you got up and walked to the galley. There was no attempt by the crew to check the cabin to see if anyone would like something for most of the flight.
   All in all a crummy experience, our return flight was pretty much the same.","2018-06-04"
"4","First time flown with Air France","Very easy check in, friendly staff and helpful at Birmingham Airport, the flight went on time, we had complementary voucher for snack and hot drink on the flight out bound.

We was shocked how quick the flight was before we knew it we where landing...Great","2018-06-04"
"2","Even when it's not a strike day, you don't necessarily fly!","When we booked our tickets in December, we had no idea of the problems we would encounter with Air France in April.  First of all, we were never told that the air fares we were offered when we booked included NO checked luggage -- and that the cost per bag would be 50 euros!  We also were only guaranteed a seat on the plane (maybe together, maybe not) unless we ""volunteered"" to pay for assigned seats ahead of time.  We opted to take premium economy seats for a little extra legroom for my 6'2"" husband. We thought it was worth the $284 extra.  Then we learned that flights on eight days in April had been announced as ""potentially disrupted"" due to labor issues.  Among them was our flight from Miami to CDG on April 24th. AF offered to cover our costs to switch to another carrier, so we contacted Delta who told us we could fly from our local airport to JFK (instead of driving 4 hours to Miami) and get on their AF code-shared flight,  They also would be able to honor our seating arrangement on that flight. Air France however does not fly from the west coast of Florida, so no, we HAD to go to Miami at 6:00 in the morning to get the flight to NY on Delta.  We had also booked a separate flight from CDG to Geneva and ordered our rental car to be picked up at the airport there. So even though April 25th was NOT an announced strike day, our flight to Geneva was annulé.  We ended up taking the TGV (at our cost) plus two cab rides (50 euros each) to get to Geneva.  On our flight back to Miami 17 days later, we were treated like cattle.  They called to board the flight and then marched all of us into a corridor where they left us with NO information, NO access to seating or water, and NO air conditioning for an hour before finally letting us onto the plane.","2018-06-04"
"4","Flight crew great-I felt valued","After enduring terrible customer service with Ryanair in the same week, I felt so valued as a customer by the kind, respectful Air France crew who seemed genuinely happy to serve. What a reassuring reminder that the large sums of money we travelers spend on flights is justifiable with some carriers. The team that served me were all-male and they just rocked!","2018-06-04"
"4","First long haul flight for many years","My flight was staged via Paris and Seoul to Osaka.
All of my flights were comfortable, and the cabin staff were attentive! The food on the first flight was a basic crossiant with no accompaniments! No jam or butter - not even a paper plate! The food on the subsequent flights was of a better standard all together! I would fly Air France again!","2018-06-04"
"4","Good Basic Service for a Short Flight","Flying from Newcastle we had no problems and the flight left on time. In flight attendants helpful and friendly. Smooth landing but a bit of a wait for the luggage to arrive. Not expensive and we got what we paid for.","2018-06-04"
"2","Never again...","Don't even know where to begin... The Charles De Gaulle airport is the most disorganized airport I've seen (and i have 250K+ miles on air and used almost all international airlines out there). Upon arriving for my connection to Atlanta, GA, USA, I was in complete confusion where to go and what to do. There was no one giving instructions, no information center that I could find and the boards are completely useless - they indicate the gate you catch your bus from to your connection, but they do not match the gates' signs on ground. It was ridiculous. Upon asking a staff lady for help, she told me to wait, as she was busy. Busy with what? Sitting on a chair? I then, asked passengers, who were as confused as i was and at the end, we were about 40 people trying to find the same gate. We eventually found it (have in mind we had to be at gate 2E to catch that bus, but gate 2E was actually on gate 3D and there was no indication to that, plus the person sitting on that gate did not even speak English, complete mess..) Then, i proceeded to my connection and got there just 15 minutes before the flight, but i was not alone. About 50% of the plane boarded last minute and everyone around me was having the same experience as I did. The flight was also terrible, the landing was horrific, it was loud, hard and painful... and it was not a weather issue, being sunny in Atlanta, it was the pilot... I will never again use Air France or go through that disorganized airport... 
My advice? Avoid them..","2018-06-04"
"2","Great service on board but terrible ground service ","I flew to Paris for work and the flight was pleasant however, the ground service at both Mexico and Paris were terrible. They are very badly organized, it takes forever to just drop the luggage despite having done an online check-in. The people in their ground team are pissed at you for just wanting to finish check-in despite that  they are the owns badly organized and taking hours to take care of one person. After the flight it took 3 hours to get our luggage and we never got any info from their team in Paris. ","2018-06-03"
"3","Air France / Delta don’t talk to each other","90 minutes of horror in Paris.  Basics:  Book via Delta indicating AF service, last leg back to Atl., arrive to check in with confirmed reservation but unable to get boarding ticket the night before, show up at AF check in and they have no idea who we are.  Took AF 90 minutes to finally get their numbers to coordinate with Delta.  Ran to gate and got on just in time.  Bad news:  Delta.  Good news: AF 777 premium economy service was superb and flight was delightful.","2018-06-03"
"5","They know about flying!","All went really fine, I have no words to say how much the team is engaged to give you an excelent flight, since the enterteinement on board until the dinner and many details that make the customer fell grateful for the choise.
But, I have a complain and a warning: NEVER, no matter what happens accept a conection in Charles De Gaule airport. It was the worse moments of my life. Nobody to tell which was the connection gate, the airport was desert when we arrive 10 PM. The next flight to Brazil would depart in half an hour and i and many of the brazilians began to  complain about the uninformation. We ran, all over the airport, until the moment that we distinguished in the distance the letter we were looking for. Nobody understand any English and when we finnaly found two members of the airport they were not of any help, saying us to come back, since they  could not understand that we were saying L and not F! Finnaly , when I arrive to a dead end, I found a man who seemed to work there and I asked to him. And he he signed to go down to reach the right gate. It was just in time. I got sick of tension and stress.","2018-05-26"

"5","Surpassed expectations ","Finally took a transatlantic flight with a airline I was very unfamiliar with. So far this is the best airline I have flown. The 9.45 hour flight was excellent. The food choices were good as well as the inflight entertainment. I upgraded seats at time of purchase and it had extended leg room as well as overall space. I ran into a problem with another airline from Barcelona back to Paris because of a strike, and had to rebook. It was super easy to rebook for another day as well as for the same upgraded seating. ","2018-05-26"
"3","Depending very much on....","With Air France, you may have the best and the worst experience depending on many parameters. That is why I chose the ""average"" rating. For example, if you travel to Africa, you get old aircrafts (A330 in my case) not ""yet"" refurbished with malfunctioning / tired seats, and poor IFE quality (screens seem 20 years old, and maybe they are actually). You can also see that AF has chosen not to spend much money on keeping those old aircrafts look still ok. On the other hand, service level can also tremendously vary from one flight to another. You can get the average+ (what I received during my last flight), fantastically sweet and service oriented staff or, at the contrary, get the old and tired I-want-to-retire-now flight attendants that can make your journey really unpleasant. This is not ok for such an airline, especially if you consider the high prices AF charges. Of course, it is always easier when there is little or no competition...","2018-05-26"

"5","Final leg from HKG to YUL","I used my Flying Blue miles to upgrade from Premium Economy to Business class. Well worth it. Even though I like Premium Economy, I just had a 12 hour flight from HKG to CDG and needed something better. After enjoying some of the layover in town, I returned to the airport and headed to the lounge included on my ticket.

My flight was leaving from the L gates in Terminal 2E. This lounge looks fresh and I've included some photos. There were a couple of small free pour bars, two small buffets, large sitting area with many charging spots, huge showers, a couple of different quiet areas including one to lay down and apparently a bit of a spa, but I didn't check that one out. The showers were a huge plus and no one was using them. However, this must be the only Air France lounge without Crème de Cassis. What, no Kirs?

Boarding was immediate. I left the lounge when the screens indicated that the boarding process had begun. There was no line for Sky Priority. It appears that 5 of 28 business class seats are open. It was full going the opposite direction. It's a Boeing 777-200 on this flight, fitted for 3 classes; Economy, Premium Economy, Business.

The seat has a decent sized screen, about 2 inches wider than my Surface Pro 2. There is a shoe bag for your shoes and slippers and socks. The personal kit was passed out later. I tried playing some podcasts recorded on my phone through the entertainment system but it was laggy and bulky. Not a good experience. There is a reasonable amount of international movies on the system.

Meal service is lengthy, served in several stages. A warm towel followed by drinks and an amuse bouche of squash purée and shrimp. Next was drinks and appetizers including cheeses. Finally drinks and the main course. I had the ricotta and asparagus lasagna; very tasty. Finally drinks and dessert. It was a cute collection of tiny sweet desserts and a port.

The seat extended comfortably to a near flat position and I slept soundly after the drink service. I skipped the arrival lunch as I was still full from before.

Landing was uneventful at Montreal. Immigration and border control was empty except our arrival. So processing was fast.

Very enjoyable. Well done Air France. But don't forget the Crème de Cassis in the lounge.","2018-05-26"

"4","Quite good","We were lucky to travel on a strike day and my flight was not canceled! The business cabin was quite empty. The service was good, the flight attendants were very attentive. I asked to sleep first, it was a night flight, and have my dîner later, which they answered no problem. The down side was the seat on the airbus a330, it is the old business class cabin 2x2x2 and not full flat. It was disappointing because they flew with 777 during winter season with configuration 1x2x1 and totally flat. Beside that, flight on time, food OK not tremendous but OK.","2018-05-26"

"4","LONG Flight - Attentive Staff","The flight was long, but the staff was attentive without being intrusive.  Most tried to sleep as this was an overnight flight (according to our destination).  Meals were served at a good time to allow us to try and acclimate to our new time zone.  The free movies were very nice, the headsets comfortable, the larger leg room was good (though we had to pay for every assigned seats).  Wonderful to find a row that only had two seats with three in front) so we had extra room.  Overhead compartments were nearly impossible to access in flight (noticed others struggling), so keep you goodies with you!","2018-05-25"
"5","Exceptional experience","The best in-flight safety video of all airlines - classy, informative, aesthetically presented. Great food service, the very best comfort.","2018-05-25"
"2","Cannot believe they don't provide flat bed seats in business","Air France has one of the nicest business class and the service is always great. However, recently, I think the airline is going through a couple of issues.
* Sky Priority is always a nice way to go through security in Charles de Gaulle.
* The lounge in Terminal 2E at night time is a zoo - completely packed. I think they are doing some work in the terminal so maybe it will get better.
* Food and drinks are lovely in AF business - no exception on this flight.
* BUT and that is the killer: for a 11h flight in business, you cannot in 2018 no offer a flat bed. This is CRA-ZY. Especially on the A380. I cannot believe Air France did fit their most premium and new plane with angle-lie bed.
Every time I fly on this route, I struggle to understand what crossed the mind of the engineers who decided to order this plane","2018-05-24"
"5","always smooth","I frequently fly between Bordeaux and Paris  and I always love it. My seat was relatively roomy. They served a drink and small snack even though the flight was only one hour. I had to get used to the check in process where you get a tag for your bag as well and then scan your boarding pass and bag. The service was great.","2018-05-24"
"3","They canceled our flight with only 33 hours before","As I said, they canceled our flight and emailed us. It was a real luck that I opened my mail that morning and when I saw the Air France mail I nearly get sick: I already paid around 1000€ for museums tickets, public transportation passes.
 If I hadn’t called at Air France I don’t know when I would have rescheduled our flight.","2018-05-24"
"5","Professional, Prompt, and Satisfying Cancellation Experience","My flight out of Paris to Torino, Italy was cancelled minutes before my arrival to the check-in desk at the Paris airport. My disappointment was soon subsided when I was met by a friendly and efficient Air France employee. She found me a flight flying to Milan (2 hrs by bus to Torino) with in the same hour, all I had to do was change terminals.... easy enough. Once on the flight, the attendants were warm and welcoming and I was provided multiple snacks and refreshments along the ride home. The flight was quick and painless. 

In Milan I luckily was able to catch the last bus that night back to Torino, cost me 22 Euro... a small expense but one that I wouldn't have had if I flew directly into Torino as planned. My kind and prompt Air France employee that helped me switch my flights back in Paris mentioned that I should make a claim on Air France's website asking for bus fare reimbursement. So naturally being the cheap, broke college student I am I did. I kept the claim light hearted, making fun of myself multiple times for asking 22 Euro from a multi-million dollar airline company. Fully expecting that this situation would get resolved in a week or so and having to fight with customer service for the reimbursement... I was met with an email within 6 hours. Not only did Air France agree to reimburse me for my lost 22 Euro but also gave me a 350 Euro future flight travel voucher good for any Air France, KLM, or Delta flight, and additionally gave me an option for 250 Euro bank credit (this is additional to my 22 Euro - so 272 Euro if you are counting). Big surprise to me... or anyone reading this I can imagine. 

The reason for my flight cancelation in the first place.... Air France crew strike.

Oh the irony. 

Moral of the story; laugh at yourself, your time isn't as important as you think it is, be kind to customer service, and don't be afraid to ask no matter how little.","2018-05-24"
"4","Pity about the industrial action","Prompt, efficient, genuinely friendly, comfortable. Even in economy, it was very good.

I would have taken several other flights with them, including two very long-range ones, but their schedules simply cannot be relied on. Your flight could be cancelled in the strike.

I’m not making judgement about who is wrong in the current industrial dispute but the victim is the traveler (remember them?) who must make late and very expensive schedule changes.

My advice is to use other carriers till it’s resolved. Pity really, because Air France is better in the air than the others.","2018-05-24"
"4","Good service and airline ","We flew on Air France between 20th and 21st May 2018 doing a multi trip. The original flight between LHR to CDG Airport which is only 45 minutes flight. They still provided food and drink which is a nice touch considering how short the flight is. The staff were friendly and professional in greeting us. Leg room for me was good, obviously no on-board entertainment due to the shortness of the flight. Was a nice flight over. Good national carrier so l wouldrecommend this airline company to everyone.","2018-05-24"
"5","What a wonderful flight!","I took the air France flight by accident, since I needed to fly quickly.
It was such a wonderful experience, that I can't wait to fly with them again. 
First, being tall enough to feel uncomfortable with the leg room in the normal seat, it was a pleasant surprise to hear from the staff that I can move to the front more comfortable seat, without asking for it!
Second, the on flight meal was so good, I had to look outside the window to make sure I'm flying. 
We went up on time and arrived on time. 
Wonderful!","2018-05-22"
"4","Charles de Gaulle Transit Lounge Clinches our choice of airline","Flying with Air France to Bucharest was mostly pretty fabulous.  It's a pleasure to while away an hour or four in the super-luxurious transit lounge near the Yotel - comfy sofas, day beds (dream on - you'll not bagsie one of those!), books, power charging points.  And peace and quiet, a million miles away from the usual hectic airport shenanigans...  Coming back was almost as fab, but having lost all bank cards en route and with a very very finite amount of currency, it was annoying to find that I couldn't pay our luggage allowance fee in lei (Romania's currency) at the Air France check-in at Bucharest - Euros only.  Shops in Otopeni airport sported hilariously high prices for everything, so don't leave present-buying till you get here.  Air France 's food, complimentary drinks and general service meant that I was adamant that we'd go back with Air France mainly because of the fantastic CDG lounge.  Heathrow / BA take note...","2018-05-22"
"5","Excellent -- when not on strike","I always fly Air France on my trips to New York because the attendants are elegant, the service courteous and the apéritif, dinner and wine excellent. 

Because of the strike I recently had to change to AF's partner, Delta, where the attendants could not speak French and execrable wine was served in plastic cups on which was written ""Coca-Cola.""

Fully relate to the travelers whom the strikes destabilized. But they are temporary and the excellent service is permanent.","2018-05-22"
"3","Disappointed","A national airline we expected a minimum of politeness and consideration from the staff, but they were often huddled in a corner discussing and couldn't be bothered with the passengers Meals were almonst literally thrown at us , little information given and on a long flight no intermediate refreshments were offered or information on where to find some if not. 
The breakfast was served  in a terrible hurry due to the fact the cabin wasn't woken with enough time , and to cap it all the quality of the food was not good. No choice for the evening meal , and the breakfast  was very unsavoury 
Perhaps they were more concerned about their prochaine greve .","2018-05-21"
"3","Mixed Thoughts","Firstly we have no problems using Air France who form part of the KLM umbrella. However we cannot recommend Paris Charles De Gaulle airport which is their main airport for transfers. The system they have of further passport and security checks means horrendous queues and delays. Even with a 1.5 hour transfer time we were within a whisker of missing our flight. The airport needs a complete overall and you would think Air France could influence this.","2018-05-21"
"5","The best way to go from Paris to Shanghai.","Exceptional level of service at the airport, from the terminal gate to the aircraft door.
Very nice cooking experience ""Alain Ducasse"" at the departure lounge ""La Première""
Sailing staff  very smiling and professional.
The comfort of sleeping allows to arrive rested at destination.
However I prefer the refurbishment of the latest generation of cabins ""La Première""","2018-05-21"
"2","Attitude of staff needs adjusting","I am a regular business traveller with this airline but on this occasion they were not helpful to me personally 
The flight was delayed and we were kept in our seats for an hour by the crew 
When seat belt off finally came I needed to use the bathroom and they had started serving drinks 
They told me I would have to wait longer which I have a medical condition so I had about used up my waiting time
I had to insist and they then behaved like disgruntled children - there was no inconvenience they just had to move the trolley a few feet so I could pass

They say they are there for security and comfort 
Given they failed on the latter I am not sure I have confidence in the former 
It’s not the first time I have observed Air France staff treat customers as an inconvenience 
Disappointed","2018-05-21"
"1","NEVER AGAIN","absolutely never again.   worst flights in my life (from Paris to Santiago, then returning from Buenos Aires to Paris).   in both cases seats so narrow and no legroom to speak of (and i'm only 5'4"" - my partner 6'3"" was in agony!!) - nearly 13 hours of this - hideous experience, not helped by the staff who served us disdainfully (doing us a favour?).   the food itself was OK, the entertainment was OK, but the overall experience we would never choose air france again.   have been on package holidays where the seating was much more comfortable than this scheduled airline - a disgrace.","2018-05-21"
"5","End to End service","Granted it is first Class but it's several notches higher than most others. Don't even compare BA which is no where near on hard product. Impeccable service, escorted through the airport then onto the plane. Nothing too much trouble.","2018-05-21"
"5","NY city break","Not often used Air France but I would recommend and fly with them again as the service was excellent. Staff were very professional, always smiling and very helpful. Seat and services available were top class and made my flight all the more enjoyable.","2018-05-21"
"5","Great flight very accommodating","My flight home from San Francisco with KLM was cancelled so they put me on another flight but it didn't suit me so I changed and they put me on Air France - San Fran - Paris - Amsterdam and then onto a KLM City hopper back to Norwich.

I missed my Board Meeting. 
Air France is off my list","2018-05-21"
"3","Nice new jumbo jets, very comfortable, disappointing seat choices","I had not flown in ages so I was very surprised and disappointed to learn that I was unable to choose my seat even when I logged in right on the very second of opening of check in-time online. I had to pay R1000 extra to not get one of the sardine seats in the very middle. It was the same on the way back, this time I did manage to get an isle seat but it was by the skin of my teeth. Not sure if this is just a peak season thing or the new norm? 
The flight was otherwise incredibly smooth (take-off and landing was a breeze), and the new jumbo's are pretty comfy with nice USB chargers and real headphone jacks (I flew last long haul in 2014). The flights were 100% on-time and no issues with check in etc, and my luggage popped out unharmed. 
Also, they had almost no extra blankets, and you cant regulate your airflow individually anymore so you get blasted with aircon right on your head throughout the flight. I was thus pretty cold on the way in despite dropping a stilnox I still woke up ever half hour, but on the way back I made sure to have a beanie on me and I dressed a lot warmer so that I was ok with just one blanket. The food was pretty good, I enjoyed it. I ordered a vegetarian meal and it was filling and tasty (I'm a meat eater but I find when you fly its better to go vegetarian, you get your food sooner so can eat sooner and drop a sleeping pill sooner etc, and lighter food is just safer, as your digestion is compromised at such high altitudes.","2018-05-21"

You’re being driven in a car to your plane and the first class seats turn into a private cabin with a large single bed. They prepare it while you change into pajamas and the level of noise is remarkably low. It would be nice if upon arrival, first class luggage arrived first and someone from the company retrieved them for you as Garuda does.","2018-05-21"
"4","Back hone","luckily empty seat next to mine. More space for 12hours flight. The two meals were 
  Better than my previous flights on AF.  Flight staffs are correct.  Sometimes other flights attendants are more communicative.","2018-05-21"
"2","never again","the flight was performed by JOON, the service wasw terrible, and the meal was terrible too, I had fish  with several plastic pieces inside I never had before such a tasteless meal","2018-05-21"
"4","a decent airline","it is really a good airline company  ..a weather problem happened in JFK before leaving they were sorry for that and in 30 min they booked us a night in a very good hotel at the airport and was good flight.","2018-05-21"
"5","Excellent Service","I booked this flight on line. I had never done this before and was very unsure about the process. Well what a fabulous service and I had no need to worry. Self check works and the communication was spot ont. the flights were on time and the staff were excellent providing professional top services. Thank you","2018-05-21"
"3","Passanger Comfort","I had a night flight that should have been comfortable to try and sleep. However complete opposite. I was very uncomfortable due to being hot. There were no fresh air vents on the flight. On the way back I travelled Premium economy. Likewise no air vents.
The cabin staff very rarely walked around to offer refreshment during both night flights.","2018-05-21"
"3","Havana","we had booked Air France to Havana with a change at Paris. Due to numerous strikes we had to change our flight to.Paris just in case our original flight was csncelled.. just as well as it was .. Tjis meant paying for a night in Paris

 check in on all our flights were very slow.. so bad that on our way back from havana our flight was delayed which made us miss our connecting flight so yet another night in Paris!!
the flights them selves were good with lovely food and drinks.. staff were very kind and helpful

 ","2018-05-21"
"5","Choose if possible","Air France Business Class has an impeccable service. From the moment that you step on the plane to the moment you disembark.
The cabin crew is all very service minded, caring and make you feel well taken care of.
The food is of very high quality and is presented well. 
The seats are spacious, feels private, has a lot of storage. All seats have isle access. The monitors are large and well responding touch screen. The do show the latest movies onboard.
I would say Air France is on of Europes best airlines when it comes to quality and service.","2018-05-17"
"3","So-so experience","The economy seats were cramped.  There was no leg room to speak of and the only thing that saved us was the flight was not full so there was no one next to us and we could spread out a little.  The flight attendant's were barely polite.  (T be fair we found out later they were going on strike the next day and that may have had something to do with the attitude) Their croissant's were delicious though I will say that.  When we reached CDG to change planes we had to go through customs although no one told us it was customs or that we would have to do this so that was an unpleasant surprise and it was TSA all over again only worse.  I would not fly Air France again if I had a better choice.","2018-05-17"
"4","Pleasure to ride","15 of 28 Premium Economy seats taken. This seat was way better than the previous Air France Premium Economy seat. Although, I find the armests too low to properly support my arms and it causes a strain in my shoulders. Boarding took about 45 minutes. Services provided in French, English and Chinese. The flight is approximately 12 hours.

The entertainment system touch screen is very responsive. Decent line up of movies, tv and music. Lots of international stuff. My personal favorite is le Grand Mix radio station. They provide a couple hours of an eclectic mix, unique programming. I also like the ability to plugin your own USB stick and play it on the system.

Dinner was surprisingly good, particularly the Chicken Florentine. Then approximately an hour and a half, a lunch or scrambled egg with a spinach and mushroom cream sauce was served. Also good.

","2018-05-17"
"2","Never again","The usual miserable experience at CDG, partly the airline's fault. Air France really messed up our tickets. Once on the plane we were told there would be no wifi for the 9+ hour flight. The electric outlets for our row of seats didn't work. Four hours into the flight I got sick from the entree they served and spent the rest of the flight suffering the effects.","2018-05-17"
"4","On time","Hi I tok i air france in partner with Air Joon from oslo to paris these month for  weekend vacation
i truely love the punctuality of these airline even i know there was a strike for Joon Airlines employees  it was still on time both from Oslo to Paris vice versa, i did not give a score five since costumer service on flight could be better...","2018-05-17"
"4","Premium economy seats","I booked premium economy seats to provide 40% more leg room for my husband. While there is definitely more leg room than economy, the ""pod"" seats do not recline. They do have a footrest but we found ourselves sliding in the seats during the night.  Are they worth the extra price? Probably, as passengers in economy did not have the extra space.  Next time, we'll seriously look at business class.","2018-05-17"
"3","Not my first choice","Checking in at Naples at the Air France counter was extremely slow, I don't think I have ever seen anyone move that slow in an airport before.  The directions to the gates were very poor.  The seats were much smaller than we have experienced on long haul flights and uncomfortable.  The food was not good...at all!  But they did have a good selection of beverages and were always available to assist.  For the most part, the flight attendants were good (except one lady was like a bull in a china shop - very rough and aggressive when serving).  Our flights were on time and connections were fine.  Overall, Air France would not be my preference when booking - we booked through Delta and ended up on Air France.","2018-05-17"
"4","Smooth","Everything was very well handled from the boarding to landing. The staff in-flight were excellent and helpful. A good light meal on this short flight and nice champagne. Not a single complaint. pleasantly surprised. ","2018-05-17"
"4","On time, comfortable planes","This flight had a very long stage from Paris to Madagascar and the short hop from Paris to Heathrow. In premium economy, seat was comfortable and reasonably spacious though the difference in price compared with economy was much greater than the difference in facilities. Staff on the short flights were excellent - friendly, welcoming and attentive. Less so on the long haul. Curiously breakfast was served just over one hour before landing although that was scheduled for 10.45am local time and had left at about 1am local time. This meant that it was quite rushed and it had been a long time since we had last eaten. Worst thing though was travelling through Paris CDG - surprisingly short of toilets and food outlets for a major international airport.","2018-05-16"
"5","Excellent service, timeliness and comfort","The service on Air France is excellent. The flight was punctual and connections worked very well. The seats were very comfortable. The food selection was wonderful.
Overall Air France made a long flight and journey very comfortable. Would highly recommend.","2018-05-16"
"5","New B777 Business Class","The Herringbone  seating was quirky and took some getting use to for a few minutes. The way it is laid out you might see a portion of one other passenger if you leaned forward. I like having the cocoon wrap around for more privacy and the lay flat seat. The entertainment system was great. The food was incredible 2 years ago and much better now. Service in this class is incomparable, it makes domestic first class say on United look wanting. The Sky Priority is great,  short lines and the lounge was great, you could practically have lunch there.","2018-05-16"
"2","Airfrance is not going well these days. Avoid until pilots change their attitude.","We flew as family: my 1.5 year old kid, my wife, my parents-in-law and I.

Liked best:
- Luckily they did not strike that day...

Liked least:
- The departure has been delayed of an hour. The reason was never explained.
- Although the plane was 4/5 full (i.e not so crowded), I was separated from my kid and wife ?! My parents-in-law seats were also split, although you could see empty lines of seats.
- If you book an Airfrance flight these days, get ready to endure the stress of thinking about ""Will they fly or will they strike?"" all the time. I'll avoid Airfrance for this very reason.","2018-05-16"
"1","Business Class not worth the price ","Flew Business Class flight 82 from CDG to SFO.  Used miles to upgrade.  I wish I could recover the 75,000 miles I used for this flight.  Service was inattentive and hurried (in the air for 11 hours and meals were served as if we would be landing soon). Twice used call button - just to get a beverage - and after no response had to physically get up and go the the galley to ask for service.  I’m capable, but expected more assistance.  Food was not at all good, and again, hurriedly served, and of course not cleared with any promptness.  After meal service, attendants no where to be found.  I would must rather fly Premium Economy for 1/2 the price and better food and service!  Sorry Air France - not good and can’t recommend.","2018-05-16"
"1","Not a family friendly airline! ","Booked and paid for an infant seat as part of our group of 6 people. We arrive at the plane only to find that we were seated rows from the infant seat area on a long haul flight. When asking the air hostesses about this they were very rude about it and after much fuss they were willing to move just me to a whole other cabin so I could be with the baby at a bassinet. Problem is that meant we were split from the whole group, including my 5 year old son. They were not fussed at all! ","2018-05-16"
"2","Booked through Delta","I read nothing but great reviews for this airline. Unfortunately, my experience was not so positive. The plane was very dirty, amenities antiquated. Food was just horrible, the airline’s interpretation of chicken piccata. Entertainment was not very entertaining.  I wanted to like them but didn’t.","2018-05-16"
"3","Disappointing Business Class","Although the flight was smooth, however, service, comfort and seats were disappointing. Flight staff seemed unconcerned and not helpful (more than likely due to the strike problems the airline is experiencing). Have flow numerous times in business class in other airlines, and withing a few minutes after boarding, the flight staff offers drinks and are very welcoming and accommodating to assist.  Not so with Air France.  After the meals, waited for the plates to be picked, finally gave up, and took them to the galley ourselves.  Also, the air conditioning was erratic--hot--cold, mainly hot. The entertainment kept going off and had to reprogram numerous times.  Food was ok--were expecting a more high quality since it's a French airline and French cuisine is super!!  Excellent wine choices!!","2018-05-16"
"3","Problem with plane, missed connection!","Our flight departure was at 6.45 a.m. We got to the airport at about 5.10 a.m. After a long wait in line we finally boarded the plane around 6.30 a.m. We were seated for about 15 o 20 minutes when we were informed that there was a minor problem in the cockpit with some sort of transmission devise and they were calling a technician to repair it. After about 45 minutes on the plane we were told that they had to order a spare part and that it would take a little while go get it. We were on the plane about 2 hours, until the spare part finally arrived and we could depart. The explanations given during this time were almost all in French, and very few in English, even though there were a good number of Americans on the flight. I had not problem because I speak French and had to translate to my wife  what they were saying!  As a result of all this we missed our connection in Amsterdam. I have to say however that the airline had already placed us in another Delta flight taking us to Detroit (instead of Atlanta) and from there to Tampa. Unfortunately when we arrived in Detroit we realized than one of our suitcases had not arrived. We finally made it to Tampa, at about 11 p.m. and put a claim for our lost suitcase. I am happy to say that Delta was very efficient in this sense and we had our suitcase home at 9 a.m. the following day. As I commented on a previous review I was not very much impressed by my AF flight from Atlanta to Paris. Definitely their sister airline, Delta, offers a much better service!!","2018-05-16"
"5","First flight with Air France","I have to say what a great experience. Great check in. On time. Bigger seats than BA short haul for sure. Nice friendly staff.
And best of all... no idiots that want to recline their seat in front of you! Always a bonus that. You get a free croissant and tea coffee and water if you want one.","2018-05-16"
"4","RELIABLE AND EXCELLENT BUSINESS CLASS, PARIS NY","Had many flights with AF from Paris to NY, some in economy, some in business class; both were excellent! ( However, totally different experience on their Paris-Montreal route where we felt like cattle...)
Business Class is really great, although seats do not recline 180 degrees ( depends on aircraft)
Service is excellent and food exceptional, the headphones make all the difference in noise reduction, IFE is amazing, including exrecices to improve blood circulation during long flights, and the leg room is great","2018-05-16"
"4","Smooth flight","We have travelled this route a couple of times, and have not encountered any issues with Air France. Check in was pretty straightforward as is bag drop off once you know how their system works at CDG. Flight attendants were friendly and service was good, better than a couple of other European airlines we have flown with. ","2018-05-15"
"2","ALWAYS late!!!","Every time I take a flight with Air France, the flight is late! Either 30 minutes, either 2 hours. It needs to be something. They are completely unreliable! Cabin crew is nice and polite, and snack is fair (2 macaroons or salty crackers)!","2018-05-02"
"5","Smooth even with the Social Movement in France","Even with the disturbance of the Social Movement in France, Air France did their best to honor our flights even with a major change on the way back.  2 thumbs up!","2018-05-02"
"3","Joon flight operated by Air France to be precise","When booking online on AF portal it was not obvious that we would go thru Joon. Price difference was not so obvious as well
Service was ok (newspaper before boarding missing). No delay. Very limited space for the legs (I am 1.83)","2018-05-02"
"1","Air france terrible experience","Big disappointment  from Air France. Left our hotel in Paris at 8:00am yesterday after reconfirming our reservation online.reach to airport 3 hours before time to meet an overbooked flight resulting in us, along with 7 other passengers to Accra to wait until 20 minutes before take off to tell us that our seats are not available !!!miss our flight that we booked  and confirmed and paid for a month ago. We finally was able to join another AF flight to Abidjan transit to Accra via SA.Just arrived home in Accra at 23:57 via Abidjan and with South African Airlines and Without our luggage!!! Very unprofessional and very disrespectful!!! Worst experience we ever had with an airline, not to mention the nonchalance and carelessness of the costumer service.","2018-05-02"
"5","Pleasantly surprising","While security can be looked on as tiresome and an inconvenience the level and way it was conducted at Orly Airport was very comforting. Generally internal flights are more relaxed but not so in this case.
The staff were professional and polite at all times. When I headed into the plane and they realised I was the only English speaking person on board, the added English in their announcements. They farewelled me as a person of value also.
In Biarritz the desk staff were equally as helpful and accommodating.","2018-05-01"
"4","Nice flight - bad entertainment ","The flight was at time. The baggage reception was quick. The flight attendant were also friendly. 

I don't give 5 stars because the seats weren't comfortable. Also the entertainment in the flight is an small screen (I don't think even if is HD). You don't see anything. Even ajusting the contrast. 

If you have a good phone/tablet. Bring your own entertainment. ","2018-05-01"
"5","Smooth flight, on-time and great service","This flight went smoothly and was made relatively enjoyable by the attentiveness of the staff and the myriad of entertainment options.  I was also impressed by the quality of food and drink.  Being a French airline, I was expecting a decent full French meal and was not disappointed.   The offerings included an apératif, wine with dinner and a digestif.   Bread and cheese  were also included.  Well done for an airline meal!

I was most impressed with the entertainment options.  There were hundreds of movie and TV show options as well as music and even video games.  I slept some of the flight, but found the time passed quickly as consumed almost the entire season of Vikings while on the flight!

The seats were roomy enough for economy class and I was able to stretch my legs almost all the way under the seat.  At 6'1"", this doesn't happen often in economy. 

The flight attendants were great and responsive without being bothersome.","2018-05-01"
"5","Excellent flight","Really appreciate the service offered by Air France crew on this flight. Everyone has been very kind and willing to help any of the persons present. Food was good as well, timing was respected. A good experience!","2018-05-01"
"2","Air France: Limp and lacklustre","The plane we were on had definitely seen better days (one of the stewards had to sit in my seat and forcibly move the thing as it was stuck) and the service was very average. I realise it was my own doing, but I was even scolded for using the business class toilets (I was sitting in premium economy)! The entertainment selection was good, but then the screens we were watching were poor quality. The whole experience was simply lacklustre. Never again with Air France.","2018-05-01"
"2","Not I pressed","Very disappointed with the service here. We were all given fancy menu s, offering champagne as a aperitif. I was lucky to get a beer. While the menu itself boasted a meat n fish dish, the fish dish was inedible. Breakfast wasn’t much better, pancakes drowned in a runny jam. Crew not particularly interested in the passengers. Just take what’s given- no alternatives.","2018-05-01"
"5","I love rhe food","I love food, seat are very confortable. Fly attended very kind.i could sleep pretty well.
Bathrooms clean, we arrived on time","2018-04-30"
"4","Enough space, nice crew","We flew for a 7 day trip to SF. Seats spacious, crew very nice and competent. Service of course not like in business but good value for money.","2018-04-30"
"4","Comfortable seating, friendly staff, food soso","Flew to Singapore with our little daughter. She (2years) enjoyed a seat of her own in which she slept for 10 hours. The adults managed to get some shut eye too. Food on Air France is not what it used to be... but the overall experience was good.","2018-04-30"
"1","Strike an excuse for poor service ","We had the unfortunate experience of traveling on Air France en route to Venice to celebrate my sisters 23rd wedding anniversary yesterday. Due to strike action our flight to Lyon was delayed, but we were assured by Air France staff at Orly not to worry, as they had confirmed that we would make the Venice connection. As it turns out, not only did we miss the connection but got rerouted through Frankfurt, which flight also got delayed, eventually arriving at our hotel in Venice at 2am, without our luggage which has yet to arrive. When complaining to the Air France manager at Lyon we were told that the incorrect information provided was nothing to do with her. Customer Service leaves a lot to be desired!!","2018-04-30"
"5","very good crew,","welcoming crew, the food is not to be remembered, but the service is great, confortable seats, if you like water with or without sparkles, orange to grapefruit, a small chocolate, they do care","2018-04-30"
"5","Wonderful, wonderful flight - worth every penny!","From check-in to baggage pick up, this flight was excellent.  If I could give check-in and boarding a 12 out of 10, I would.  AF cabin staff are absolutely stellar!  They are always available for whatever you may need, but are unobtrusive and very quiet throughout the flight.  Meals and wine service were what you would expect of AF business class.  We would definitely fly AF business again!","2018-04-30"
"4","Except the local strike, it was ok.","The flight was OK. not too much space for the legs but in general was fine.
The foods is horrible but that is how it is on most flights.","2018-04-29"
"5","Honeymoon","We selected Air France with a lay over connection with Delta. We’re loved the team from Air France they were so sweet. The flight was 8 hour from LAX and they made it very comfortable. Food was good too. You know it’s microwaved but they do their best with it!  Thank to the whole Tahiti team you were great!","2018-04-29"
"5","GREAT 👍🏼","I was surprised I was upgraded from Economy to Business Class when I rode Air Franc last December. The flight from Paris to Sao Paulo took 12hours, and it was the best 12hours of my life, as far as flights are concerned. Haha","2018-04-29"
"1","Horrible experience","Horrible communication. Be warned, they weigh your check on at random. If you are 1 kilo or more over their 12 kilo limit with ALL of your carry ons you pay 85 euros. Also I had 2 reserved seats in the body of the plane on an aisle. They moved us to the very back into seats that do not recline without our permission to accommodate someone else who made a reservation after us. I understand someone needs to sit there but we had reservations for better seats for months. They wouldn’t switch us. Then there wasn’t room for our carryons that we did manage to get through. Absolutely ruined my trip to France.  I will never fly Air France again. Don’t fly them.","2018-04-29"
"4","Good service, No hassle","This was an outbound flight with accompanying 27 students (14 - 18 years old) for a 10 school trip to Washington and New York. The check-in was done online 36 hours before the flight, an easy and simple process. Once at the airport we were able to check our bags into the hold and proceed to the security. At the checkin the Air France staff were extremely helpful. Once through security we proceeded to the gate and boarding. Boarding is always the same melee which is ridiculous as everyone has a pre-defined seat. The flight, in-flight service, on-board films and comfort were acceptable to being in Economy class. I would happily fly Air France again.","2018-04-17"
"5","RESPECT OF TIME AND SMILING SERVICE","Although this trip was rather short it has been very pleasant. The service is always very smiling and esasy going, this is one of the reasons I like Air France. The plane was confortable and the space between the rows larger enough to be confortable.","2018-04-16"
"4","Air France provides consistently good service","I fly Air France frequently for business.  The planes are comfortable and the service is good.  The flight attendants are friendly and happy to respond to additional requests.  The food is ok, but I just don't like airline food at all.  What I really appreciate is that in Business Air France still provides the paper slippers to wear over your socks.  The bathrooms are clean, but because of the small size it is difficult to wash your hands without spilling water on the floor.  The slippers keep your feet dry.","2018-04-16"
"3","Seat reservation not honored","Have been a fan of Air France since my honey moon in 1968. This was the worst experience that I have had. Let me set the scene. Paris to Detroit during Spring Break. We had paid for a seat reservation. When I printed my boarding pass for the 777 I did not realize it was a middle seat.","2018-04-16"
"4","Air France ""On Strike""","Staff was lovely for all of our Air France flights over Spring Break (March 31-April 8th) even considering that they were a bit short-staffed with the ""rolling strikes"" going on when we were flying over to France, and when we were flying back to the US a week later.  Definitely worth paying extra to reserve the ""DUO SEATS""  row 49 (A&B) and row 50 (A&B) if you are flying Economy.  Our small children appreciated being close enough to the toilets, but not so close that smell was an issue.  Very nice. Seats were okay for Economy Class and I am a larger woman.  Food & beverage service was very quick.  Audio/Video equipment worked great.  Pretty nice selection of newer films.  We had an 8 hr. flight from the US to Paris, so that was appreciated.  Cabin temperature was okay, not quite as warm as some other flights we've been on.  Plenty of storage space above for our larger carry-on bags.  USB port worked great for charging our media.  NO WiFi, which was okay since we knew of this ahead of time.  **FREE Alcohol** was appreciated, and they gladly handed out entire bottle of Wine, or Beer when you asked for a drink.  Toilets were extremely clean for all of the flights we were on.  A few times we had to wait a long time to get into a Toilet with our small Son because the Crew said the Captain, and Crew were using them. *Meanwhile our Son almost had an accident.  At this time the Staff seemed oblivious of our concern, and simply smiled at us while we waited nearly 10 minutes.  We had approximately 2 hour layovers, and needed every minute of this time to get through the Security checks.  Most flights were On Time, but on our flight home we had a 45 minute delay, but still managed to make our connecting flight in the US.  Would definitely fly AF again, but would only hope they get the 6% pay increase they have been striking for over the last few years.","2018-04-16"
"5","the best service","Air France is by far my favorite airline to use internationally --the lounges are the best with a free mini-facial to boot ---you want comfort ---here it is--","2018-04-16"
"4","Good flights and service.","Flight was a bit delayed but at the arrival total delay was reduced. Boarding experience was good, in-flight food decent for a short flight. Staff was nice.","2018-04-16"
"5","First Class Service","Packed flight on Double decker plane from Paris to JFK, after a long trip from Morocco. Our seats where not together, I asked if they could switch our seats, the girls tells me no Chance as flight was completely full.So I asked how much was upgrade to Business Class, which is now a days First Class in my opinion. The agents says sir it expensive, I ask how much she relies $450, I say gice me two seats, oh yeah. This is the best way to fly on an over sea trip. Full lay down reclining chair/bed. Socks, slippers, small bag with creams, comb, tooth brush and much more. Full dinner with appetizer, meal, desert, coffee drink, wine simply the best.","2018-04-16"
"5","Birmingham to CDG Paris - CDG Paris to Tokyo","Our travel agent had booked a connecting flight from Birmingham to CDG for our onward journey to Tokyo. The flight from Birmingham left on time and we were pleasantly surprised to be offered a drink and a sandwich, despite the shortness of the flight. We landed on time and the transfer was very easy and close so were had a little time to wait before boarding the 777 to Tokyo. The flight attendants were all very pleasant - the plane was clean and - by economy standards - the food was really quite acceptable. We took off on time and had a very good flight - arriving in Tokyo on time - despite being held for a short time before landing - all in all a very pleasant and comfortable flight - and we really don't see any need to pay extra for any premium service - we certainly felt the service and quality of the planes was better than our own national carrier.","2018-04-16"
"2","poor seat allocation and food","From the start the seat collocation was chaotic. We were allocated seats rows apart even though we booked and confirmed well in advance. On board someoene was sitting one of our seats and staff were not prepared to confront they said we should ask the person, an elderly lady to move.

Seats were ok but not comfy to sleep

Food was very poor, It was dry, overcooked and not what it said on the menu","2018-04-16"
"3","Yet again AF","Another flight cancelled between EDI and CDG.  Had I not been on Business tickets I am sure I would have lost a day.  As it was AF transferred me to Lufthansa via FRA which at least got me to BKK the same day as planned albeit it much later.  Now having difficulty getting my airmiles for the ourbound flight from AF.  Waken Up!!","2018-04-16"
"3","Air France","Don't choose Air France if you are on a business trip!  Their notoriety for strikes will most definitely impact on your business meetings,  should you be caught in one such event.  Yes,  they will re-route you at their expense, but you won't be offered anything else - from a meal,  or accommodation in the event of a layover.  If you wish to be compensated,  you will need to lodge such a request on your return home.  Trying to do an online check in was the first we knew of the strike and we elected to go to the airport to get tickets reissued,  only to be turned away with the instruction to report to the check in counter at 0800 the next morning for the new flights.  No discussion on where we would stay for the extra and unforeseen night.  Returning to Johannesburg I did register a compensation claim, which was approved.","2018-04-15"
"4","A perfect scheduling","I actually needed to fly to Milan and contacted Alitalia first because I had unused miles that were expiring. Those who have tried the option ""cash+miles"" with Alitalia know that this is impossible to use from Japan and even by phone, whose operators are impossible to reach (nothing helps) and all the people I knew personally don't word there anymore. After giving up, I just called Airfrance and got on the phone immediately and got a ticket, the ticket I was originally considering, but that flight was fully booked at the time. It's the flight that departs a few minutes before midnight from Handeda, an incredibly perfect time to fly to Europe. You have all day to do your usual stuff, be it work or at home before leaving and then you can dine in relax and buy stuff. Meal is of course nothing special in economy class on any airline and Airfrance is not an exception. With a minimal budget you can buy your favourite delicacies or bring your own stuff. The wine on board is good and they keep it coming. The enertainment offer is fair and the touch screen was working well. The flight was pleasant and I recomend it especially if you fly with kids as they'll sleep for almost the entire flight. In the moring you arrive in Paris for your connecting flight and land in the country of destination fresh as a rose. On the way back you can enjoy shopping in Paris C.d.G. airport as if you've been in the city. I was a ""Flying Blue"" member long time ago and got few upgrades in business-class which was very pleasant. Sorry for Alitalia...a bit more investment in either operators or call-centers outsourcing and a bettwe web-designer would have made the difference and no wonder they're always on the verge of bankrupcy.","2018-04-15"
"4","Excellent bed","The new bed on the 777 is excellent, very spacious and comfortable I slept very well. The service was great, staff are top class. The food was ok good presentation but just ok taste, but the wine was excellent. Highly recommend overall.","2018-04-15"
"1","Our first & last Air France flight.","My wife and I have taken more than 30 flights on several airlines world wide. This flight on Air France was a nightmare experience to say the least. Although we are low budged travellers I always choose good hotels and airlines not to spoil an otherwise pleasant holiday. I made our booking through KLM who provided a great flying experience to Europe. Unfortunately they code share with Air France who provided our return flight to South Africa. Upon our check in we discovered that my wife and I were allocated seats in different rows by Air France despite having made the booking 8 months in advance..We made several calls to Air France while attempting to be seated together - all in vain. We were just informed that the seats had been allocated and cannot be changed. My wife is extremely uncomfortable about flying on her own. This resulted leaving bad memories in an otherwise enjoyable Europe holiday. This was only the start of a very unpleasant flight. The crew member that served us was not only unfriendly but outright rude.  When the vegetarian dish that my wife had ordered arrived with her name on it was given to the passenger next to her. When my wife mentioned that it was actually her food, the crew member just ignored her and slapped something else in front of her. This must have contained pork that my wife is extremely allergic to, causing my wife to spend most of the flight in the toilet with an upset stomach. When she went to the back to obtain some snacks (as most of her meal ended in the toilet) this rude man just said in a very abrupt way "" what do you want"". During the flight this rude individual spent some tome having a conversation in French with the couple seated next to my wife, and even offered them champagne. 
We have had several flights operated from non English speaking countries like:
Singapore Airlines
Etihad
Lufthansa &
KLM
On all these airlines we experienced very friendly and attentive service.
Air France is an airline that I would most definitely not recommend to anyone.","2018-04-15"
"5","Amazing flight","It’s a short flight but really enjoyable. The flight attendants are pleasant and smiling. The food is good and I had a glass of wine.","2018-04-15"
"1","Don't take a chance","My trip Moscow/Lisbon via Paris was a nightmare! They were striking in CDG and to the last minute they wouldn't put me on an alternative flight, or return my money (though, even if the ticket is not reimbursable, in this case they're supposed to do so). Finally, at the last minute, I was rebooked on KLM. In Lisbon, instead of enjoying my vacation I had to check every day, for the whole week, the status of my flight every day to get back home. I made calls from the hotel and had to wait for at last 30 minutes to talk to someone, and the calls from hotels cost a fortune! Finally, I've got a ""ride"" on KLM. That was the worst trip I had in 30 years!!! If you can avoid Air France, do so!","2018-04-15"
"3","Dated Hardware","This was Flight 689 (B777) connecting in CDG for Flight 1082 (A320) to Prague.  AF Flight 688 on return to ATL a week later. There was a partial strike going on but fortunately I was not affected.  While the ATL international terminal is not that old it is very inconvenient to get to and signage is extremely poor.  The AF flight was on time and boarding was smooth.  I knew from seat guru what to expect and it met those expectations of the old standard 2-3-2 config.  I had 1A going and 1L coming back.  I am glad I selected those seats as stepping over the seat mate would have been quite the ordeal.  Seat storage is non-existant and seat power is poorly placed.  Food service was timely but that is about it for positive comments on food.  The food was marginally better going to Paris than it was returning to ATL.  I could only eat half of what was presented.  Some looked and smelled most unappetizing. Service throughout was average.  I have made 4 international trips in the last 12 months and AF is in last place.","2018-04-15"
"1","I'll try to avoid Air France in the future","Many things went wrong on this trip:
-departure delayed, leading to missed connecting flight
-ordered special meal was'nt served
-on the way back we had to wait 1,5 hours at a Air France Customer Service desk to get the boarding passes for the connecting flight
Well, this can happen. What annoys me is that the Air France just don't seem to care.
During the flight the board crew were nowhere to be seen. We told them about our connecting flight, were told that on the ground there would be people help us catching the flight, but that was not the case.
During the flight I was told that the missing meal would be reimbursed, but, you guessed it, nothing happened. I had numerous contacts with Flying Blue, Air France, back and forth, issue still not resolved, despite promises from Air France to the contrary. At each contact with Air France I did not have the impression that they actually cared to resolve the issue, they just followed procedure and that was it.

This is not the first time I have a bad experience with Air France, this one just tops all of them.","2018-04-15"
"5","No problems","The flight departed on time and had no issues at all. We did receive an email 3 days in advance of our flight we were notified of a possible cancelation due to a strike. They kept us informed and luckily, the flight was not canceled.","2018-04-14"
"2","Flying Air France was a disappointment! Seating policies exceptionally bad!","Air France seating assignment policies combined to make my flights an unhappy experience. I had requested —-and paid for—- a Premium Economy seat on an isle but was assigned an in board seat backed up against a hard wall. And no where was there an opportunity to change it. The seat was uncomfortable. 
And the instructions were impossible for me to understand. The monitor did not work properly. I was told seat 16F was an aisle seat. It was not.","2018-04-09"
"4","Modern planes and an outstanding service","This Dreamliner and its seat arrangements offer a great comfort for working, pleasure and sleeping. The cabin crew and its service was outstanding, very polite, always passionate to support and serve best. Entertainment as well as food quality leaves some space for improvements. Beverage and wine selections were great.","2018-04-09"
"5","Best Flight I’ve been on","Hands down the best flight I’ve ever been on. The flight was long but very comfortable. They have updated seats with basically iPads as monitors. The food was very good and the service was great. I did sit next to a huge dude but other than that it was very pleasant and it’s not their fault a 6’5 350 pounder was flying next to me. Take off and landing were butter. Overall would definitely do again. 

Paris airport of the other hand. Half a star because it had no good restaurants that were under $60 per person.  Spending $120 for lunch for 2 people is the last think I want to do at an airport after spending 9 days on vacation and traveling home with a layover at lunch time.","2018-04-09"
"5","High Standard and quality","Nice and modern 777 airplane.
Check in fast and easy.
Some room to improve lines organization.
Great amenities even in economy (earphones, and eyes cover)
Good food and alcohool options included.
Great staff on board.
Departed with 30 min delay (due to storm) and recovered in-flight.
Will flight again with them","2018-04-09"
"1","Nightmare","This review is not about the service I received while inflight.  This is just about getting across the water back home to the US.  Air France seems to be always on strike.  I was not even notified about my flight getting cancelled until I tried to check-in a day before my flight home.  Two years ago, I flew Air France to go to Barcelona.  They had a strike going on too but the flights carried on.  We just had cold food because the flight attendants were too lazy to heat up the food.  This time we swore we wouldn't fly Air France so we flew with Delta, who turned out to be affiliated and operated by Air France.  Because my flight was cancelled, it was hard for them to rebook my flight home along with the other hundreds of other customers.  I was on hold on the phone for over 2 hours.  Once I got the flight and confirmation, I still couldn't check in at the airport.   The system couldn't find our names.  I had to wait in line to the service desk to see what was the hiccup.  It took a long time to get our tickets and we almost missed the flight home.  As bad as United is, fly United or any other airline.","2018-04-09"
"5","Paris 2015","For the first time, and only time so far, my wife & I flew in an Airbus A380 double-decker operated by Air France.  It appeared to be a rather new airplane, as most of these models are, and to our delight we found that Premium Economy seating on this aircraft is on the upper deck.  

Our seats were roomy, had great legroom, electrical connections for computer and phone chargers, and because of the class of seating we chose, we got extra amenities that economy class did not.  These included a better selection of food & drink (complimentary alcohol, not afforded to the economy passengers, I think) seats that reclined much more than an economy seat would, easier restroom access due to the fewer number or passengers on our deck, and more attentive service, I believe, again due to the smaller number of passengers that our flight attendants were responsible for.

I was unable to select the actual date for my travel, which was summer of 2015, because the date selections only go back to May of 2017.  I doubt that things have changed at all from my trip until the present day, especially with this airline and on this type of airplane.","2018-04-09"
"5","Wonderful! Premium Economy is well worth it!","Our May 2017 flight from LAX to Paris was about 11 hours. My friend and I were taking a two week trip around France. We only paid a little extra for premium economy and were so happy because we had always flown economy.  Premium Economy felt like business class with all the perks!
The crew was super polite, the comfy seats reclined, lots of space for carryons and leg room, delicious food and wine and large selection of entertainment.
We were able to sleep for the first time ever on an airplane! They give you a package of extras including toothbrush, eyefold, blanket and pillow.
Snacks and drinks were offered constantly and the meals were so tasty!
I enjoyed the flights to and from France so much that I am searching out other destinations that use Air France!!!!","2018-04-09"
"3","Packed like sardines in Economy","Two negatives, right off the bat:  the flight attendants had allowed passengers to exceed the overhead storage spaces corresponding to their seats; consequently, by the time we took our seats we had to search all over the plane for storage space, as our overhead compartment was totally full.  This is absolutely unacceptable!!  Secondly, stay away from the Boeing 777!!!  Elbow room is non-existent!!  Eating one's dinner is easy only if you are a contortionist.  (This problem was eradicated on the return flight, as we flew on an Airbus A380.)  Food was mediocre to inedible (orzo???!!!   Who serves orzo on a flight??)  Nevertheless, it was 3 days before Christmas, and everyone was in a happy mood.","2018-04-09"
"5","Flying Air France from Houston,TX","I experience with Air France has Always been very good.Great equipment and Great Customer service. On future trips to Paris I will Fly Air France once again.","2018-04-09"
"4","Cocoroco !","Evrything was very good, my seat was comfortable, easy check in, except the luggage I had to pay 80euros for 11kg !","2018-04-09"
"4","A nice way to visit Russia","We took a flight to St-Petersburg, Russia from Montréal with a transfer in Paris.
On the way back I spent a few days in Paris. 
Flights were on time an transfer was easy.  Nice large seats are available in the airport in Paris for a nap.","2018-04-09"
"4","Air France from Dulles to Paris - take the later flight each way for a better experience","Much better experience taking the later flight both ways.  The plane is smaller (777 vs A380) and the Business configuration is 1-2-1.  The Airbus is a huge plane, but the Business configuration is 2-2-2 and you are likely on the upper level so it takes longer to deplane.  The later flight to Paris gets in after the rush hour so you have less time to wait for your hotel to be ready, and the later flight back to Dulles gets in after the crunch time going through customs. The seats are individual pods that fold out flat.  The food is mediocre considering it is Air France.","2018-04-09"
"3","Flight OK, airport awful","The flight was OK. The Premium economy seat was not too comfortable. The bathroom layout was not good. You had to go thru either Business Class (which is frowned on by the staff) or thru the regular economy section (which means a lot of people).

The flight originated from LAX. I flew in on Southwest from San Jose. I arrived several hours early in case there was an issue with the SWA flight. Inside the LAX terminal it is a complete disaster. My flight was not yet on the (small) departing flights board. No help desk of any kind. The nice police officer told me I just had to wait. Finally it showed up on the board, but very frustrating.

Net - just an ordinary flight - ordinary to poor, but an awful airport.","2018-04-09"
"5","Great flight","Very enjoyable flight. Seats recline flat, food is good, service is great. Business class provides a level of comfort that enables you to be somewhat refreshed when you arrive in France.","2018-04-09"
"1","Worst airport customer service","Traveling with High school french class group of 36. We tried to check in our luggage at the kiosk.  We were able to print our boarding passes, but  the kiosk would not work to check our luggage.  The customer service lady told us to get in line for a customer service agent.  Half way through the line 3 customer service agents leave and now there were 2 agents to work the line.  Finally a 3rd agent arrived, took me an hour and a half to check in one bag.  Couldn’t help but compare how quickly and efficient the experience was on the out at the Air France ticket counter at LAX where it took me 10 minutes to check my bag.  
  After all the stress and rushing to the gate in time for boarding they announce a twenty minute delay that turned into a two hour and 45 minute delay.  We stayed in the boarding line until they announced boarding would finally begin, to be told we would have to exit the boarding line back to the entrance of the economy line.  Due to the security guy that was coming back to ask us the 3 security questions about your luggage.  Not sure why he couldn’t ask us at the entrance of where we were already standing, such a joke.  Just like the 3 security questions are a joke.  The gate agents made no effort to let the people at the back of the line know what was going on and why we had to exit the line. When we asked why we had to exit they just answered “security” with a smug look.  We never left the line, no one had left their bags unattended, no one had asked us to carry something for them. So after 3 hours of waiting to board they inconvenience the passengers even more with this fiasco.  Will never fly Air France ever again!","2018-04-09"
"5","No problem to get informations for stop in L.A.","It's a very long flight , arround 22 hours and the crew is very considerate with passenders thay come several times to ask them if they need something","2018-04-09"
"1","Worst Airport/Flight Experience Ever To Europe!","OK. We have been to hell and back and we know where its gateway is: Charles De Gaulle Airport with assistance from Air France. OMG. My husband and I have travelled to Europe nearly every year for many, many years and this has got to be the worst ""Insanity at the Airport"" experience ever. Endless lines to check baggage, endless lines at security (AIr France didn't accept TSA Pre so we had to take an elevator to the basement of Dulles where an ""Ellis Island"" experience ensued as hundreds of travelers in no discernible lines were screamed at by Air France security staff in a state of total confusion) a new World's Record in endless waiting at Customs at CDG (2+ HOURS with only 2 (!?) clerks working to process well over 500 travelers in line) and, to top it off, they lost our luggage. Actually, we never check luggage because we know the chances of it getting lost are great. But, despite the fact that every other airline over the past 20 years has allowed us to carry on our tiny suitcases, Air France would not. (I guess the only way they can lose it is if they force us to check it in the first place so that's why they made us check it. -- Insert Primal Scream!!) And, despite the fact that we put the tags on correctly (Air France can't be bothered to have staff to do that) and put them on the baggage claim belt ourselves, Air France didn't even send them on the day we left.  Heck, why would we want our luggage to go with us?? The day we were returning to the US we went through multiple security checks at CDG (I believe our boarding passes were scanned at least 6 times) and, to make things really ""fun,"" just as we were about to board, I had to go through ANOTHER random security check.  You'd better put on your hiking boots if you are going to traverse Charles De Gaulle because everything is miles from the next thing (baggage check, security, more security, finally, your gate.) I know the French are on heightened security 90% of the time but so are the Brits at Heathrow and Gatwick as are most of the other European countries, and we have never, ever encountered the problems and poor attitude we did dealing with Air France and CDG personnel.  Air France/Charles De Gaulle was a nightmare on every count  --  except one!  When we actually were airborne, the staff/flight was fine but every interface with Air France on the ground (at Dulles and CDG Airports) was unprofessional, rude and chaotic.

We love Paris but we'll never, ever fly Air France again. Great trip (once we got out of the airport!) but, they'd better invent that ""Beam Me Up Scotty"" technology soon to get you from one continent to another before all air travellers lose their minds.","2018-04-09"
"5","Excellent service. Early arrival","For the last 14 years, we have flown Air France at least 4 times a year.  Service has always been excellent and the food quite good for an Economy flight.  In all that time, we've only had one late arrival.  Once, about 10 years ago, a bag with sporting equipment was lost. Air France reimbursed us for the equipment so that we could have it during our trip.  Ultimately the bag was found.  It was lost in the bowels of SFO's baggage system - Air France was not at fault.  I've flown millions of miles (mostly for business) over the years and Air France is the most consistent of all the airlines.","2018-04-09"
"2","2Hr delays and poor climate conditions","The plane returned to the terminal from the runway, due to low tire pressure and then had to refuel before departing 2.5 hours late from Paris. It would seem that normal checklist at the departure gate would have caught this problem. Once in the air the cabin temperature was excessively hot and a number of passengers complained without any correction being made. One can always add a blanket to warm up but you cannot cool down with the assistance of the carrier.","2018-04-09"
"3","Wonderful Cabin Crew Let Down By Tired Plane","The Cabin Crew were professional and courteous but, the fold out tray in the arm rest was extremely worn and shabby looking. The TV screen swivel was loose leaving it tilted at an odd angle. 

The meal was unacceptable in either quality or quantity. Approximately a tablespoon of ground beef and some vegetables. The dessert appeared to be hydrogenated oil whipped up with a little sugar in it.

I can't blame the cabin crew for the seat or the poor meal, The well used seating needs to be replaced.","2018-04-09"
"5","Fantastic trip as usual ","I do like Air France , the stewards are nice , the service is good , I know what people think about Air France strikes it is bad for the image but they can’t help sorry. ","2018-04-01"
"3","Just OK","Not an unpleasant flight but just OK.  I didn't feel anyone went out of their way to make a difference.","2018-04-01"
"1","Really bad!","Not sure if I was in business or first- but I was in row #1, so whatever is there best service for this route, a 9-10 hour flight. 
Wow- food was awful! Could not eat it. Not even a cheese plate on a flight to France. Cabin and technology extremely dated, think 20 years ago. Bad!
I do not like transferring through CDG either. Horrible signage- unhelpful people. 
KLM and Emirates are much better to get to India from the Pacific Northwest.","2018-03-31"
"2","Bad checkin experience","Firstly no priority line for people with children, we had a 1 year old, which is the only airline so far that we have  travelled on that did not do this. Secondly was forced to pay for luggage even though I had printed proof I had paid online. Thirdly my baggage 2kg under weight but my daughter luggage 1.5 kg over, instead of pooling how luggage weight like other airlines, was made to move belongings around. Fourthly was refuses to allow stroller to the boarding gate so had to check in stroller at another  line, and carry baby to plane. This was particularly annoying when we saw other people with strollers at the boarding gate, and when we asked they said the person who checked in their luggage said no problem, and just tagged it and let them keep it.","2018-03-31"
"2","Flight from hell.","It had been a dreadful day due to bad weather and I know the staff were fed up just like we were but it was still their job to look after passengers. I pressed the assistance button twice to get a drink of water so I could take some tablets and twice it was switched off and I was ignored. Eventually they came round with some drinks and a bite to eat which was very welcome by this time, as it was a long flight the lights went down and a lot of people slept but a lot didn't, not once did any flight attendant come round with a drink until another meal was served before we landed. Very poor service, not interested in passengers at all. Not a good flight.","2018-03-31"
"3","uncomfortable in economy premium","was strongly encourage to try the premium economy seat even though it was an additional 700 per fight on top of the economy fare..since the seats were reported to be exceptionally comfortable.  well i got a seat that didnt move and legs were stuck up so it was an extremely uncomfortable seat fot the entire flight.  much worse than regular economyl  i would not take an air francony premium again.   also the headsets didnt work  so there was no entertainment for the entire trip.  very disappointing","2018-03-31"
"4","Nice and easy","Typical flight: short, sweet, to the point. I'm not expecting anything superfluous, but I am expecting to survive unharmed and uninjured...so, congrats? I'm not about to ding on anything I didn't do, I mostly read and slept so I didn't try the food. I was just happy to be flying and starting my vacation.","2018-03-31"
"3","No frills and terrible food","We flew AF from OR Tambo to De Gaulle and then on to Paris. I can say that everything was on time, despite a current strike in the airline, so that is one positive thing I can mention.  They also moved our seats at the airport because apparently there were no screens available in the seats we had booked, which was also nice to not have to deal with that once we got onto the plane

But the airplane was quite old. And the food is genuinely bad. AF likes to serve croissants, but my grocery store in the Netherlands has better croissants, and it really does a disservice to the French to serve these things on the plane. They're like little cold bricks.  Otherwise the food was bland- and we were served childrens yogurt that was quite sugary.  

So in essence, fly AF if it is cheap and you don't really care about the experience in getting to your destination.","2018-03-30"
"5","A pleasant surprise from Havana","We heard negative comments about this service when we were in Cuba. Our experience was a pleasant surprise - check-in efficient, cabin staff extremely pleasant and helpful, flight on time. If there are 2 of you travelling I recommend paying the extra for the double seats towards the rear of the plane. We were in row 55 A and B. Plenty of extra space and easy access to refreshments at the back of the plane during our overnight flight.","2018-03-30"
"1","The flight was cancelled ","My flight was cancelled because the airline workers are on strike so we have to go from the airport Charles the gaulle to Orly and wait from 9:00a.m to 5:00p.m. And nobody knows nothing about the flights cancelled.","2018-03-30"
"2","Expected a whole lot more","We had a linked flight from Amsterdam to Johannesburg via Paris with Air France. As they are linked to KLM, which always has very pleasant service, our expectations were high (expecting the same as KLM). We were going to fly with the Airbus A380 which is a lovely aircraft, the interior though was most basic and the seats were not comfortable enough for a intercontinental flight. 

Further, the crew’s English is rather poor and hard to understand. The pilots often screamed commands to them via the sound system, interrupting the movie or music.

Lets finish with a good thing: the food was really good as were the drinks that they offered.","2018-03-30"
"4","Evening / overnight rest!","A380 - great plane, quieter than a 777 but just a personal thing. Crew were very helpful and professional. Although there are food options available none suitable for my food allergy. Made enquiries prior to the flight and there were no problems / issues with taking my own food for the flight - beware of the liquid restrictions. A Drs letter to confirm my condition was suggested but never requested - better to have one and not have an issue at the airport. Would fly again with AF.","2018-03-30"
"4","Shuttle service","I took the regular shuttle, to reach Paris in a little bit more than one hour. Timing was perfect (departure just in time), but the boarding process was somehow chaotic, no priority for frequent flyiers. The plane was packed, so it was challenging to place all the hand luggages.","2018-03-29"
"5","The Parisian Touch","Very comfortable and such a friendly crew. The flight was very comfortable. Crew really were very caring. Cannot forget the friendly smiles every crew members had. CDG has improved a lot sine the last visit.","2018-03-29"
"5","comfortable and pleasant flight and friendly and helpful attendants","I enjoyed my long flight very much. It was very smooth and comfortable. Flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. Food was tasty and not ordinary. Thank you Air France!","2018-03-29"
"3","Delta and Air France not coordinating information","The food and the flight crew on the Air France flight were great, as were the entertainment options.  Why then only 3 stars?  Because we booked our flights several weeks before and even secured assigned seats.  The day before the Air France flight, I tried to check in online, on both my phone and later on my computer.  I kept getting an error message that didn't make sense.  
       When we got to the airport (three hours early), we were told that we'd have to fly stand-by, because we had checked in late and the flight was overbooked.  At first, I assumed I had just done something wrong.  However, when we were waiting at the gate (for our ""stand-by"" status), we met two other parties who had had the same experience as we had: they had not been able to check in online and were then told they'd have to fly stand-by because they hadn't checked in.  This, despite the fact that we'd all made our reservations (and confirmed our seats) several weeks earlier.  
      The only thing we could figure out was that we had flown to Paris on Delta and were flying back on Air France.  It seemed that Delta and Air France had not coordinated information, despite the fact that they are ""partners"".  With partners like this, who needs competitors?! (sarcasm intended)
       In the end, we were all able to fly, despite the fact that the flight was said to have been overbooked, but the waiting was extremely stressful.  This was an instance of extremely poor coordination among partners and tremendously distracted from the entire experience.  I still don't understand how it could have happened, and to (at least) three separate groups of people.
       One of the later questions asks if we paid for priority boarding.  No, but I have a Delta Sky Miles card that automatically gets us priority boarding.","2018-03-29"
"4","Muito boa","I have had problems with damaged bags and inadequate care for people with disabilities (wheelchair users), but the customer service, on return, was very good. There is a good space between the seats. There is concern from the on-board staff in, for example, keeping windows closed. Good meal options. I consider one of the best companies to travel to, to or through Europe.","2018-03-29"
"3","I flew Joon and it feels safe and reliable","I've had a mixed experience with Air France. On my way to Paris the flight was first delayed for 4 hours (there was a general strike in France the previous day, so the first flight could not take off since the plane had not landed the night before). They put us on another plane at 10:30 am but the plane was not AF or Joon. It was blue panorama and some of the passangers decided not to fly. We were then placed on an afternoon flight. All day lost at the airport. Terrible experience.
However, on the way back everything was just fine. Flight on time. Plane seemed new. Crew were nice. Everything went very well. We even flew over Paris and could catch a nice view of the whole city from the air before leavint.","2018-03-29"
"4","Great staff and food!","The staff on board were really lovely and the food was good too. The Champagne aperitif went down well too!","2018-03-29"
"1","Uncomfortable experience","I had an uncomfortable experience with a stewardess with Air France. She without explanation why moved an Asian passenger out of her exit row seat by the window to a middle seat in the back for a French speaking passenger. 

I don't know the circumstance but this is how it unfolded and I somehow because of the language got involved.
The plane was full. There was an Asian tour group on board. This young lady was sitting in the window seat of the exit row, naturally a wider roomy option in economy. A blonde stewardess came and was asking her English or French, clearly the passenger didn't understand either. Nobody nearby was intervening so I several seats back caught the stewardess eye and asked what is going on. The stewardess asked that she needed to move her seat. I had to ask her why. She repeated she needs to move to this seat which I notice was the middle seat in the back. It was the middle seat, not in the exit row, away from her tour group. I asked if this was necessary while I noticed a French speaking man with his luggage standing by the stewardess side. He was a slight well dressed man, not really tall or big. Maybe he had a condition I don't know. But I speak several languages and was simply looking for a more polite request than a demand that you move this instance. 
The Asian lady, bless her realized what was going on and picked up her stuff and changed to the back middle seat. I told her she is not obligated to do so. But she smiled and moved. 

There was no explanation, no polite request, no soft tones, neither in French or English. What was worse was a rolled eye when the lady got up, a perfunctory thank you from the stewardess to her, but plenty of pleasant exchange of appreciation in French between the stewardess and gentleman.
Later I learned the Asian lady was pretty sick before the flight so the tour coordinator had changed the seat from another tour member.

I just felt bad. I would like to think there was a very good reason to take away her seat. But isn't there a nicer way to approach this?","2018-03-29"
"4","All flights on time and comfortable flying!","Everything was great except for the ""Gluten Free"" food on the flight from Toronto to Paris!  Unfortunately, Air France combined the gluten free food along with dairy free and Vegetarian meal.  This made for a totally unappetizing mixture of inedible ""stuff!""  A cracker with no butter, a non dairy desert, a non meat meal, etc. Without meat and dairy a gluten free meal just doesn't work!!","2018-03-14"
"1","Air france from Dulles to France","Flight was late which caused us to be 5 minutes from being kicked off our connecting flight.  
Luggage was originally placed on wrong flight, several Air France customer service staff told us many bags are misplaced in Paris.  The lock for my suitcase had been broken off and my stuff had been rummaged through.  
Luckily our baggage eventually was returned to us.","2018-03-14"
"3","2nd stage of flight to singapore","We were delayed an hour in the departure lounge as it was snowing. The time of departure kept changing after the original time had already lapsed by some time.
When we finally got on the aircraft, we sat there for 2 hours while the aircraft seemed to taxi round the airport. There was no information given. Eventually we were informed that the plane had to be de iced which took about another hour. 
We know they could not help the whether, but we needed more information.
When we finally got off at about 1.30am, we were given a meal, but we didn’t really want this as we were so tired.
There was snacks and cold drinks available during the night but there was no information about this.
By the time we received breakfast we were over hungry and earlier I had to ask for some rolls for my husband as he was starting to feel ill. We wished we had taken some food on board, but it was our first long haul.
On the flight home we did this and it helped.","2018-03-14"

"2","Air France at its worst in New Delhi","I try to always fly with Air France. Their planes are clean, modern and the flight attendants always friendly and helpful. My experience flying out of New Delhi to Paris was the opposite of my expectations with Air France. The two or three counters they have to check in open just about three hours before the flight. This is inconvenient for a crowded and chaotic airport like Delhi. Then the flight was delayed about and hour and the ground personnel seem totally ok with it and not at all apologetic. The lounge is some ridiculous room with no windows and bureaucratic staff. All my challenges were related to ground staff who either don’t know what they are doing or couldn’t be bothered. Once I was in the air everything went back to the normal high standard of AF. ","2018-03-13"
"1","Flight cancellation","OMG so much to say, don't know where to start. On February 18th 2018 I flew from Houston to London with a stop to Paris CDG ( AF 639) . I add on line an extra baggage time of boarding registration ( which I paid with 15000miles,)  Then add another one( €192) so 3 checked luggages. I upgraded to business class( allowing  me 2 checked luggages of 32KG each , I should get my money back for one. Barely a day before,  received an email saying my flight from Paris to London was cancelled ( 6h stay in airport) During this time, no help from Air France, (should receive voucher for food). Finally I took my new flight ( AF1280) , at boarding in Paris one of a guy who checks the passeport was rude to me making  embarrassing comments to myself in front of every one . When I get home , I file a complaint under EC261 regulations, I should receive compensations , and since then nothing . I finally contact them again to check on my case and received an email , saying""  my claim is till in work progress"" . I just wondering if I would not email them, would I hear from them ? From my point of view , I will never fly with Air France . I had already so many problems like keeping changing my reserved seat, late, departure, etc ..... . So I am done . I had a cancelled flight from a low cost company once and the case where handle smoothly , with accommodation to an hotel , voucher for food prior to hotel and the best of all , received compensation in the 2 weeks after my claim .","2018-03-13"
"1","Worst customer service EVER","I was to catch an Air France flight from Amman Jordan to Paris and then YVR.  Due to the pending strike they cancelled all their flights on Feb 23, 2018.  They sent me an email in French, which I couldn’t understand.  Non of the phone numbers worked.
Finally my American Express agent got me on a flight on the 25th of Feb.  I heard nothing from Air France.  
I had missed meetings due to the delay and had to pay for 2 more hotel nights.
When I got to Paris I went to the AF lounge.  I had a 5 hr layover.  It was not busy. I was told I was economy and couldn’t use the lounge.
I said, you called a strike, you delayed my return and u cost me hundred of dollars
And I can’t sit in your empty lounge?  
They said right.
Worst customer service ever. I will never fly them again.

"1","Why is Delta Airlines a Partner With Air France?","I try not to ever fly Air France.  Flight crew do not want to work.  They do everything possible not to expend any additional effort on their passengers.  The flights usually feel as if they are worse than cattle cars. The food is really really bad.  All the way around it is a horrible experience.  Over the many years of international travel that I have experienced, Air France is the worst.","2018-03-13"

"4","Flight from Paris-JFK was the BEST flight of our trip.....","We flew on an Air France A380 as our last flight of a trip to Spain, Italy and France. The thing I LOVE about Air France is that their cabin services are of exceptional quality, and their Premium Economy product is akin to a domestic first class in the US, and is of FAR better quality than most other Premium Economy products out there, certainly compared to US carriers. 

The thing I HATE about Air France is that the check-in process in CDG in Paris is a NIGHTMARE. It's all automated, and if you have a problem or an issue with check in your luggage or printing a luggage tag (which can happen, and it did to me), there's NO ONE to help you out.  Aside from that, CDG is in general a horribly overcrowded and inefficient airport. Other than that, I do like Air France, and it was an overall pleasant flight, with exceptional food and cabin service in Premium Economy (the food and beverage service id of the same quality as Business Class), which I will ABSOLUTELY fly in again with Air France. I just don't particularly want to deal with CDG anytime soon. Air France however, overall, I will fly them again. It's a great airline.","2018-03-13"

I was on my way to the toilet, to brush my teeth, when the airhostess spotted me with the brush in my hand. I was given two cups with fresh water, as the water in the toilet wasn't that good for brushing teeth. A small thing that makes a difference.","2018-03-13"
"3","One way trip!","The fact is from my experience, you can have with the same company different opinions. This time, Air France on the way to Guadeloupe: Two days before travelling I received an e-mail saying Wamos will operate the Air France Flight. Meeting point at 7h30 AM at the airport, we will the Airport at 7h30PM to sleep in an hotel at the Airport. Long time for registration, very long time for boarding at least the far point from the terminal to an antic 747 with the fabric of the seats very old and dirty! at least two hours without information about the real reasons for the delay and then back to the terminal where we received again false explanations and fortunately a flight for the day after on an XL Airways flight which I do not enjoy, just a normal flight nothing positive, nothing negative ... The flight back from Guadeloupe was an Air France flight on an Air France 777, The kind of flight I'm happy to do perfect schedule, Cabine Crew very nice, what I usually expect from that company!","2018-03-12"

The flight attendants were friendly and attentive even though they were busy. 
I will be happy to fly with them again!","2018-03-12"
"4","Among the best. ","If you travel from Montreal to Paris, I suggest you use Air France for a couple of reasons:

-Service is better than most of other lines.
-Foods are by far better than other airlines. 
-Price is most of the time very competitive. 

Departure time from Montreal in the evening is perfect for business travelers since most of the time you’ll be in Paris around 8:00 AM. 

Recommended. ","2018-03-12"
"1","Catastrophic (even for Frequent Flyers)","I am a Gold Member at AF for a bit less than a decade. For the last 18 months I observed the deterioration of their services.
As a big fan, I reported all the issues. I discussed with many people from Air france. No improvement. It is just getting worse and worse. This flight CPH-CDG-MPL is a good example.
BOOKING
  *Application not working while booking my tickets. I tried 3 times. Then on the website. In the meantime, I received confirmation for 2 bookings on my mailbox. I had to call them and waited hours to change that.
CHECK-IN
    *Impossible to choose my seat on the international flight (CPH-CDG) whether online, on the app. CDG - MPL, my seat was on row 22!
   *Waited more than 30 min on the dedicated Gold members landline. as for another flight, that same week I waited more than 1 hour, I dropped it. Sent a message on FB. The machine made the change seat for the domestic flight. Total time: 2h30.
BOARDING & FLIGHT
    *Late. No announcement at the boarding time. So you stand in queue for infinite time...
     *45 min delay to defreeze engines...It was snowing in CPH as well as in France and most part of Europe for days. So not really a surprise.
      *No excuses at landing   

Second Flight CDG Paris
     *Late boarding.
     *No updates for 20 min, whether by sms, email, notification from the app, on the screen at the gate, or vocal message from the hostesses at the gate and not busy. I took pics and send them on their FB page.
      *The pilot came randomly at the gate, looking for the passengers and screeming ""we are setting up for a medical equipment, thanks for your patience"". No info about the duration. Updates on the screen at the gate.
       * One armrest was missing at my seat. No option to incline my seat The hostess was surprised and had no solution.
      *40 min delay for take off and 30 min late at landing. No excuses.

CLAIM
    *FB chatbot insisted for me to filla claim and sent the link (I am quite familiar with it). I fill the form. Valid. then Got a message on the webpage ""sorry. There is currently a problem. please try again later."" I informed the chatbot. They said they will submit my case to someone. 
I got 3000 miles and plenty of platitudes.
Lamentable.","2018-03-12"
"4","Cramp but only on short flights","I love Air France but for the regional flights it can be a tight squeeze.  For your person and luggage.  Many times I've had to check my luggage because it wouldn't fit in the overhead.  On my return flight this became an issue because I was going back to the US and did not want to check my carry on as I had valuables and fragile items from my travels. All was OK but was still a little stressed as I did not plan to check.  Flying them international, I find the seats are very spacious, food is good and hostesses are friendly.  With the OD TV the hours fly by.","2018-03-12"
"4","Efficient, friendly but food quality decreasing","Generally good flight, on time, with friendly and attentive service. The entertainment system works fine, with somewhat limited recent movies. However the quality of food on Air France has been dropping in the last few years, in my opinion. It's too bad, because one of the main reasons I chose Air France was for the food. Next time, I think I will try the upgraded menu you can get for an additional fee.","2018-03-12"
"1","Flight cancelled","Our flight from Miami to Paris was cancelled without notice.

"2","Trip to MIA was nice, trip back was pure horror!!!","CDG-MIA - got an upgrade to Business for € 349 which was ok and the staff was friendly and fast.
MIA-CDG - I had an accident in MIA which caused serious back pain and asked for an upgrade to business which was denied because the business seats were sold-out, I have been told. This was just a lie, I checked it and saw at least 5 empty seats.","2018-02-26"
"4","Very comfortable and pleasant flight.","Our plane arrived late in Toronto due to bad weather conditions in Paris so we departed Toronto about 3 hours late. (In Paris they have trouble coping with a little snow because they aren't used to it or equipped for it.) The business class pods on the 787 are very comfortable and convert to full lay flat beds. The entertainment system has recently been upgraded so there are numerous choices of movies etc. Food was quite good - but still airline food - and service was excellent. A very comfortable flight.","2018-02-26"
"2","Very bad experience","Horrible flight. Couldn't check in online because there was an error in our nationalities and the system didn't allow for us to correct it. So we had to check in at the airport but, by then, the airline had assigned my husband and me seats completely separated, 19 rows apart and both in the middle. There was nothing else available by then and so, even though we bought and paid for the tickets together, had to travel apart. The air temperature inside the plane for the entire flight was very hot and uncomfortable. It was a terrible experience.","2018-02-26"
"1","We are just cash machines now ","8 years ago, I used to take Air France twice a year to go to Canada from Geneva and had no problem. However, this time I booked a flight from Houston to Geneva for my husband,  myself and my two kids( 20 months and 6 months old) , and if I could go back in time, I would never fly with air France again.
We checked our luggage in Houston and gave our strollers at gate. We were in the air, I was trying to put my hand bag up when one of the stewards came to me and asked me not to put my kid on the floor. I looked at her and told her nicely that he is on the floor just for the time i am up and doing few things but she almost shouted. I grabbed my kid and sat down for the rest of my flight. 
Once arrived in Paris, I asked for my strollers since we had a 5 hours wait in Paris, they said that I will have my strollers in Geneva and not before that. No one in Houston at the check in told me that I won’t have my strollers in Paris. My husband and I had to carry the kids and our hand bags from one terminal to the other. Once we got to the other terminal, I went to Air France desk and asked if they could do something regarding our strollers or if they could put us in an earlier flight to Geneva. They told us that if we wanted to go earlier, we had to pay a new ticket and regarding strollers, they can’t do anything. The supervisor came and told me that I should go to luggage claim area and ask for an extra stroller from Air France stuff. Went there and asked them for a stroller. They had one stroller left. When I saw the stroller, I just wanted to puke. It was full of chocolate and god knows what else.It was the buggy type stroller( which of course doesn’t suit a 6 months old infant) and I was not gonna put my 20 old month son to get any diseases.
I went back to see the supervisor and all he said was” sorry if you are not happy” 
Happy??? I didn’t ask for happiness, all I wanted was to be treated like a human being who travelled 12 hours with an infant and who was tired.","2018-02-26"
"4","Pleasant","The flight was pretty standard as you can expect for a short haul.

The staff was pleasant.

Make sure you do not expect anything to eat -- you get 3 dried cookies of about 4 cm diameter and about 4 mm thickness to tease your stomach.

But it is OK.","2018-02-25"
"4","A 380 is a fantastic plane but book a seat upsatsir on teh isle!!!","Air France have improved over the past few years. A380 is a great pane that makes the flight pass faster.. However , ran out of the 2nd meal choice , screen did not work , very cramped seats ...even though we had booked and paid extra for the upstairs seating. Toilet not working ...would have expected a much better performance on a fairly new aeroplane!","2018-02-25"
"4","Cheap flight between Vienna and Paris","AF usually is not known for low prices. Competition between airlines on the Vienna - Paris route makes it possible to travel without breaking the piggy bank. Great!","2018-02-25"
"1","Worst Airline Ever","We traveled on Feb 20 with Air France. We never received our baggage at the Vancouver airport. Its been 5 days and airline has no information about our missing baggage. We have been inquiring continuously but of no use. Customer reps are useless as they always say we don't have an access to the file. What a load of crap! How come they never scanned our bags at the first place in India. I would never ever travel again with this airline and would never recommend this useless airline to anyone.

WORST AIRLINE EVER","2018-02-25"
"2","Avoid flying with infants!!!!!","Please read my experience travelling with a 2.5 yr old and a 6 mo old child with Air France. I hope this will prevent you from flying with them and be exposed to such an awful event.

I am Argentinian, live in Israel and went for a visit to my mother country alone with my two kids aged 6 months and 2.5 yr. We left Israel after making sure we would have a proper place for me and my children while on board (namely, a front row where to put a bassinette/crib). We called the company making sure this would happen and we were replied “front row is assigned automatically for infants”. Apart from the fact that our stroller wasn’t waiting for me in the connection, no other problems showed up on our way there. 

ON OUR WAY BACK WE HAD A NIGHTMARE.
I approached the air France counter and got told the flight is overbooked. The manager was called to “deal” with the situation. I was told his name is Carlos Casco. Since the airplane was full with babies (lie!!!!!!) He “suggested”:

-To take a flight the day after (the international airport is an hour trip to the capital city, far and expensive).
-To choose another airline next time (WHAT!!!!)
-To seat in the front row with a crib, but my 2.5 yr old boy would have to seat couple of seats behind me (in a 13 hours flight!). This was a breaking point for me. Negligent, careless suggestion that could have involved my son getting hurt in the case of turbulence (among other discomforts). I couldn’t help but screaming. In the end, it’s apparently what did the job.

Needless to say, I was so nervous I could feel I would faint. Had I been with my husband I would have taken it in a different way, but alone with two little kids and such an non responding company, I felt overwhelmed. 

Thankfully another woman took over (named Giselle) and calmly said they would try their best. 50 minutes before departure we got the “good news” that another passenger didn’t show up and a front row was almost empty for us. 

During the flight I discovered that we were the only ones with a baby who were assigned a crib, the front rows were only used by elite or regular passengers. Another mother with her 11 mo old son was assigned a regular seat, due to overbooking. We are speaking of a 13 hr flight, where you must have your child all the time in your hands or take him with you to the toilet instead of letting him inside a crib. 

Couple of conclusions:
-While carrying an infant, check in can’ t be done online. Therefore, front rows suitable for cribs depend on availability when you come to the check in counter at the airport. 
-Note: the stroller is delivered directly to the belts, so if you choose travelling with them be ready to carry all your bulks and toddlers through the airport. 
-Air France is simply the worst airline to fly with kids.
-I am never flying this airline again and strongly suggest no one does either!","2018-02-25"

"5","Air France remains amazing","Again a wonderful experience with AF.

Maybe the seats do not permit a perfect recline as one would wish for but the friendliness and professionalism of the crew is to be commanded.

And they definitely managed.

Felicitations a tous!","2018-02-24"
"1","Rude and dismissive","Paid extra for extra legroom seat, but due to ""rearrangement of seating structures"" the row we were in was a standard row. When we complained we got a classic gallic brush off..... total culture shock after Japan!

Furthermore , aircraft was dirty and tired, aircrew rude, and IFE at best mediocre.","2018-02-24"
"3","More squeezed than ever before","Well. Since the moment we arrived to drop the bags we knew the flight was running late. And it was indeed at least 6 hours later when the boarding began . We asked at the check in desk about a voucher for us to grab a bite at Charles de Gaulle  (considering we already lost our connection in Paris) but the lady said we have to check it out the possibility when we arrived there. It was a long time since a flew AirFrance and apparently they did magic into squeeze another chair at the same space. I'm a petit person and I couldn't move without touching the next person, who was also petit. Awful!","2018-02-24"

Complimentary drink and a pain au chocolat this really is the bar most airlines should aim for.","2018-02-24"
"1","Worst Air Line experience ever","I travelled premium economy from Melbourne to Paris via Canton. there was a 4 hour delay and as a result of the very short layover, both my and my husband's luggage was lost.
My husband received his luggage while we still in France 3 days later. Mine was not recovered until 4 weeks later when I returned home despite my daily phone calls and complaints trying to get my luggage back. I spent nearly $2000 replacing the entire contents on my bag for a four week long European holiday. 
When I first reported my baggage lost I was promised I would be compensated. 
Since returned home and sending email after email and all receipts and my bank details, I have never been compensation, 6 MONTHS LATER.
I have since discovered hundreds of similar complaints all over their facebook page and on trip advisor.
Besides the extreme frustration of this issue, the other issue was that on my return flight they refused to cater for my husband who has a nut allergy which was clearly indicated when I selected my meal preferences. The flight over to Paris was fine and we were looked after well. But upon return we were given two meals options both contained either nuts or sauces that contained peanut oil. In the end he was offered a cup of noodles. 
This was by far my worst flying experience and I will NEVER fly with airfrance again.","2018-02-23"
"2","Their heyday is over","When we were young, Air France used to be our national pride. The flight attendants were all young and tall blondes women with class. The food was gastronomical, the cheese selection was brilliant. Now all they know is about strike, there is never enough money to satisfy them. Last time I fled to Oslo, they told me in the last day that they cancelled the flight due to strike, I almost missed the other 2 legs of my flight if I didn't catch the train. Then the refund took half a year and with a pittance of 70€, not even half of the ticket. At the moment of writing this, they have been on strike again. I normally wouldn't fly with them again but I bought the ticket from KLM, I didn't know the two airlines become partners. During this flight with them, the same old cliché, indifferent service, a little biscuit and drink, no entertainment to speak of. I have to avoid them next time.","2018-02-23"
"4","Surprise","We had booked an Premium Economy flight from Nuremberg via Paris to Mexico City. At the Airport we got the surprise to got upgraded to BusinessClass from Paris to Mexico on the mighty A380. Normale as German you are not really welcomed by French people. But in the last years I don't feel anymore this angry between both nations. Our FlightAttendants at our flight to Mexico City had been very friendly and helpful. It was our first time in BusinessClass. Excellent food. Excellent drinks.","2018-02-23"
"2","Good choice for budget trip..","The journey was not enjoyable at all.. When I have to spend 13 hours on plane I expected to have movies to watch.. what they have are those old movies that you have probably seen and do not want to watch again.","2018-02-23"
"4","Good allrounder","Flew from Heathrow to Paris and from Paris to Mauritius.  The first leg of the journey was super quick as there was several of us passengers that were travelling from Paris on to other destinations.   On this flight the plane was comfortable and clean with friendly professional staff, they even offered a tasty roll and drink on this short flight.   The 2nd part of the journey was on a boeing 777  This was comfortable and modern with enough leg room and comfort to sleep.  The entertainment was good enough so you could watch a film on demand, but could do with an upgrade, however this is only a niggle.  The food was great and the staff were again professional, attentive and friendly.  Would definitely fly with them again unlike the terrible Air Mauritius we got on the way back !! Well done Air France","2018-02-22"

"1","Poor service","Our flight was cancelled so we got an option to go to another city, get one night at air france cost. We went to munich, and were told to go to their helpdesk. We couldn’t find the helpdesk, but the worst was that air france have not booked hotel for us. We tried to call air france, but they were closed. We sent a message on Facebook, but after3 hours They still have not given us an answer. 

It was a mistake done in Oslo, but it causes problem for us when we arrive munich. ","2018-02-09"

"2","Trip ruined by AirFrance","August 2017 trip to Paris to begin river cruise from Paris to Monaco.  Arrived at CDG Airport and luggage didn""t arrive. We  filled out a claim for delayed luggage, we were informed by CDG Representative that our luggage was located and would be on next flight out of JFK, and would be delivered to our hotel by 9:00 pm.  That evening there was a cocktail reception for cruise members so instead of sightseeing we had to shop for appropriate dress for the occasion. We eagerly awaited the arrival of our luggage as we were leaving Paris the next day to begin our cruise.  No luggage was delivered. we made numerous calls to AF, and were told it was with a courier and would be delivered before we left Paris.  August 27, instead of sightseeing in Paris we again had to shop for clothing and essentials. Our carryon case contained computer , camera medications and jackets, and hiking shoes, no other clothing. AF provided $100 for essentials. Try shopping in Paris with $100. We did have travel insurance that would cover costs after bag delay of 3 days. We believed AF when rep. said we'd have bags by Aug. 29, 2017 when we left Paris to begin cruise.   No luggage delivered on day of embarkation.  Frantic calls to AF gave us the same message that was repeated daily for the next 8 days of our trip.  Your bags are with the Courier there is nothing that AF can do, they will be delivered at your next port.  WE spent at least 2 hours every day for 7 days on the phone or computer trying to locate our bags.  Our twice daily phone calls to AF always was the same message delivered by phone rep.  We requested to speak to a manager but were told it was impossible. Finally on the sixth day I contacted Delta Air as AF is an affiliate. At that point we received some action, my husband's bag was delivered .  It turns out my bag was still at CDG and never with the courier. Delta Rep. had it delivered on day 8, of 11 day trip.  We missed so much of our planned sightseeing by having to shop for the next days clothing. The anxiety and frustration of dealing with the incompetence of AirFrance in locating and delivering our bags, that were at CDG the whole time, ruined our trip.  I still can""t believe that AF would not let us speak to a Supervisor or Manager. Thankfully Delta Airlines retrieved our luggage for 3 days of our 11 day trip. I would never recommend AirFrance .","2018-02-09"
"2","Poor service. ","We were not supposed to be on this flight, our original flight was cancelled and we were changed around. There was a lady that appeared very ill and was sick a lot all over the row in front of me and my partner. Now it wasn’t that that bothered me at all, it was the fact that the airplane staff then made the lady and her husband clean it up. Personally I think this is terrible, and I know that if someone was sick where I work, I wouldn’t then continue to make them clean it. Not a very good experience ","2018-02-09"
"4","Good flights","We found the flight very good, the service and staff were very good, and the food was excellent. The reason I have only given it four stars, the flight was late taking off and landing, but this wasn’t a problem for us.","2018-02-09"

"2","Very poor performance","When we arrived in Paris we had missed our connecting flight due to weather delays.  Air France could not even find our original reservations to go to Tele Viv.  We were in the airport for over 8 hours and not allowed to leave from the area where we had arrived.  We had no food and could not go to get any.  Finally Air France brought out box lunches.  We had to wait until midnight to get a boarding pass for a 10am flight in morning.  Air France sent us by bus to a hotel one hour away.  We arrived at the hotel at 2am and had to be up and on the bus at 5am for our 10 am flight.  Breakfast was to be included, but it was not served until 7am at the hotel.  Since we had to leave the hotel at 5am, we had to buy breakfast in Paris at the airport at a cost of $32.00.  When we finally got on the flight and arrived in Tele Viv, my luggage was lost.  When my luggage arrived the next day it was damaged.  I hope to NEVER fly Air France again.","2018-02-08"
"1","Arrogance of Senior Management","Following my critical review of October 2017 concerning the poor service delivered to my wife and I and in particular to inability to pre book preferred Business Class seating, I wrote on 12 October 2017 to the Snr Vice President Asia Pacific M. Antoine Passiau concerning my issues. To date I have not been favoured with any response from M. Passiau or from his staff. It is obvious the poor attitude and arrogance of AF front line staff stems from senior management such as the Snr Vice President who do not value customer service and have little regard for customer relations. It is obvious that my family,colleagues and I who are regular business class passenger to Europe shall not ever again fly AF.","2018-02-07"
"4","Nice airline","This is a nice airline, we were only on a short flight and we still got a sandwich and drink for free. Air stewardess were lovely. Only thing is was cdg airport is crap! When we come back it was freezing the gate where we were sitting as it like being in a tin hut, heaters were blowing cold air. Would not choose to fly into this airport again!","2018-02-07"
"5","A strike Day","it was a Strike day in Italy, and a few operators were working. Luckily for me and for the mates who were supposed to fly with me, we were kindly helped for the check in. On board everybody smiled and were extremely kind with all of us. It didn't matter the class we were.","2018-02-07"
"3","AF representatives at Paris airport not aware about canceled flights!","At Paris CDG airport, an AF representative told me I missed my flight 682, 10:40 AM, and would have to take a later flight, 0688 at 2:05 PM and charged me an extra $300. Found out later from the security person on board that flight 682 WAS CANCELED, and the agent in Paris failed to give me that info, I could have chosen another airline. I am a senior and went to France for my sister's funeral, filled out refund form, no response from AF. Very unfair Air France!","2018-02-07"
"3","Two Plus three Equals a five hour layover","We were coming back from Casablanca Morocco and had a layover in Morocco for 2 hours. The time went by fast and before you know we were boarding the plan. As we sat on the plane after a half hour there was a announcement that there was something that need to be changed out on the wing of the plane near the engine. It would take one and a half hours. After that time passed they came back on and said some thing in the engine needed to be fixed, that would take one and a half hours. Well after sitting on the plan for 3 hours they came back on the speaker and said we will be leaving in a half hour. I don't mind waiting for something as important as the engine to be fixed but why does it have to be on the plane. When we have a 7 hour flight ahead of us on the plane.","2018-02-07"

"4","Good Economy Class","Flying on bord of Air France 777-200 from Paris CDG to Vancouver and back. 
I had reserved window seats on the first row of the 2 seat area on the back of the aircraf for both flights. It was very good, as I had to pass only one person to get out of my seat. The prsonal space was very good for Economy Class. The food was very tasty for Economy Class and I loved the Self-Service station on the back Galley for hunger and thurst during the flight. Entertainment system worked well. Many recent movies and very good selection of documentaries. 
All in all, I was quite happy with Air France in Economy Class long haul, despite of many bad reports I had read before. I would fly again on AF Economy Class on a Triple Seven or newer aircraft.","2018-02-07"
"5","Superb service and attention to detail","Excellent service, the only down side for us was the late hour to be served food. Seats were not complete ""Lay Flat"" type but were still reasonably comfortable. One of us had difficulties with the in flight entertainment, possibly due to the fact that this was an older aircraft, but the cabin crew did their best to rectify. The Air France cabin crew just can not be faulted!","2018-02-07"
"4","One of the top five!!","Professionalism and courtesy as must for  Air France! Level of cleanliness on aircraft + common bathrooms very high. Staff perfect for any passengers need!","2018-02-07"
"4","Avoid CDG terminal in Paris","We have taken this flight many times as we transit from Europe to Ireland via Paris. However CDG airport now is an issue as immigration favours those with an EU passport and others are left to queue for hours with only a few lanes open. The African baggage handlers and check-in staff were rude and not helpful. For the flight which is operated by City Jet you are bused to the plane and walk on the tarmac at both ends. The jets are quite roomy and comfortable but with limited facilities in the air.","2018-02-06"
"3","I believe Air France is not what is was ","I started to fly Air France 4 years ago I found this company extremely professional. Now I found this company very basic may be is the fact the price is going lowered, for that they can’t keep the same standard. Before they use to do a first passage with the choice of aperitif with peanuts now everything are together then they use to give you a choice of 2 main meals now just one. The movie also are not changed often may be one a months new movies appear of course if you fly more then twice a months that become boring. But the staff still nice thank you anyway . ","2018-02-06"
"1","Very dated cabin on prime route CDG to BKK. And they lost my luggage","I flew MAD-BKK via CDG. The flight MAD-CDG was the usual. Business class is the same configuration as economy except you don't have someone sitting in the middle seat. It's not very much better than economy really, it is essentially the same seat. But you do get food served even on a short flight. 

The CDG-BKK leg was poor. The seats are the 30 degree angle, 'flat' seats. They are somewhere between curved and flat. The cushions that make the seats comfortable when sitting upright mean that when 'flat' they don't feel flat at all. And being at a 30 degree angle rather than horizontal is a major let down. 

The crew were fine and the food was OK. But the overall product felt dated and there are so much better options out there for the price of flying Business to BKK. Lesson learned, 

Oh, and Air France lost my luggage. Eventually found it in CDG which given that it was Air France all the way, and I had a 3 hour layover in CDG, is truly disappointing. It did come 23 hours later but when you';re only in the city for 2 days, its very disappointing. 

Overall I felt another let down from Air France, They used to have flair and style and now they seem so tired","2018-02-06"
"4","Good airline but be warned about cancellations","I was warned not to fly with Air France because of their reputation for delays and cancellations, sure enough, our return flight was delayed and our connecting flight needed to be rebooked. No explanation given on the text I received. Having said that, the flight was good. We flew premium economy so got extra legroom and the attendants seemed to be round continuously with a range of drinks ( unlike Etihad who only provided water between meals for a much longer flight) I was disappointed with how little the seat reclined but there was a leg & footrest provided. Food was average. OK, but not great. Welcome pack included ear plugs, toothbrush & paste, eye masks and socks plus cushion & blanket. I booked airport assistance which was well managed-unlike the UK leg of the flight run by fly be, but that’s another review.....","2018-02-06"
"5","Pleasantly surprised","The plane was a 777. Best premium economy section I have experienced but it got better.... the staff was great. Food was good... only draw back was limited alcoholic beverages.","2018-01-27"
"3","Alright if you don’t mind scanning your boarding pass 10+ times. ","When going through the gate to our flight Air France staff insisted on scanning our boarding passes 10+ times but not sure for what reason. The staff on the plane seemed helpful however we slept on the flight so didn’t have any direct contact. Woke up to a nice fresh sandwich so probably wouldn’t mind flying with Air France again for a short flight and with a little bit more patience. ","2018-01-27"
"3","Average flight experience ","I rate air France service as average. Air craft was clean,  food quality was ok but food quantity was very low. The Stewardess seem to be not happy with the passengers at all!  The best part for me was varity and quality of the offered drinks in-flight. ","2018-01-27"
"4","very nice","good flight, cabin was divided in smaller sections. good entertainment, games, latest movies, private tv screens and headset. Although quality of food was high, on longer flights we always get hungry. free sandwiches in the kitchen help a lot but still we could hardly wait patiently for our dinner or breakfast.","2018-01-27"
"4","Pleasure to take this flight.","It was comfortable flight with very limited English used.  The entertainment required to download the Apps ahead of time, it could be problematic foe the first timer of taking Air France.","2018-01-27"
"4","Good Flight Lost Bags","The flight was smooth and nice, service was OK and food was health and good.

Plane was a big Boing Dreamliner, but it felt very congested with a 3-3-3 configuration, where other wide-bodies planes typically have a 2-5-2- but they seem more comfortable.

Upon arrival in Paris we discovered that our suitcases where left behind at Boston. When we checked in 3 1/2 hours before the flight, the 2 agents at the counter were to busy flirting with each other and I notice that our bags where not pushed into the carousel,  I mentioned this and was told they will push them to the conveayer belt shortly...Obviously it didn't happened.
The staff at Charles De Gaulle airport were trying really hard to help us out, we where told that we could spend up to 100 euros to buy emergency clothing. The suitcases were delivered the next day to our hotel.

The flight back was uneventful and on time.  The on-board entertainment is very good with multitude of choices TV, Movies, Games, and Relaxation.","2018-01-26"
"4","Very French","Airbus 380 is so quiet and comfortable. Food not so great but ok however  clearly not enough. I heard the two stewards when serving the lady behind me realizing that they had only one plate left and obviousely not able to deliver the choice proposed on the menu. When the lady asked for a dish that was finished ones Steward said to the other "" why dont you give your own dish to the lady and we can eat the one left that she does not want"" the other steward said "" no way i am so so hungry after 11 hours wihh no food"" i mean in this day and age a company like air France should feed its people flying and not let them 11 hours wiyhout food...","2018-01-26"

"2","They've gone downhill","We used to love Air France.  Booking this flight was easy;  however, getting seat assignments was a challenge.  When calling in the US, you get Delta and maybe that's where the problem is.  I had paid for my sister's seat TWICE and yet Delta said I had not paid and then they said I had to show proof!  That meant a call to my credit card company and then back to Delta to provide the proof!  Unbelievable!  Probably won't consider them again unless no other alternatives.  It's too bad because Air France used to be very good.  However, on the Air France side, the food is not nearly as good as it was just a few years ago.","2018-01-25"

"2","cancellation, delay and no (premium) service","Airplane 777-300. 
I was already checked in for an earlier flight with connection in CDG to Amsterdam. Couple hours afterwards I received a message that the flight was cancelled for operational reasons. They would make a new reservation. In the night I checked my booking again and the wanted to put me on a flight a day (26 hours) later. No other options given. In the morning I complained and they booked me on al later flight with a 6 hour lay-over in CDG. They advised me to ask in CDG to get an earlier flight from CDG - AMS. In CDG the ground staff refused to do anything. Even no voucher for food or drinks. Even Air France cancelled my flight and got me into this huge delay. They did not care at all. Complains can made afterwards online. Goodbye mister. As premium economy costumer I was also refused to enter the lounge in CDG (normally possible for a fee). 
I flew premium economy cabin for this 11 hour night flight. The chair is ok for sitting straight up. You have more space around then economy. Reclining will hurt your back. There is no real recline but the seat moves downwards. There is no lumbar support and padding is almost non existent. So no way of comfortable sleep. There is a leg rest but dis functional.
Service: No welcome drink. Small water bottle was already at your chair.  After take off they started directly with a dinner service and offered one drink. It took almost 1,5 hour before they came back, not for more drinks but to collect the plates and garbage. Everything went very rushed. Service stopped then till 1,5 hour before landing. Nothing was offered in between. We got a breakfast containing only some pastries, a bit of fruits and yoghurt and half a cup of coffee. In the night you have to go half way in the economy class for an galley where you could get some water or juice and some sweets. Premium economy has also no separate toilet. You also need to line up in economy class.
The comfort of the seat will not help you if you want to sleep or relax. My advise is to book an economy seat with extra legroom, if the 10 seats on a row is not a problem for you. Bring a water bottle with you and some food. Do not have any expectation of the 
service on this long haul flight. Even if it is premium economy. It is way below normal economy service as on KLM, Delta, Eva Air, Emirates and so on...","2018-01-25"
"3","Poor service on journey home","The flight inbound was great and I had absolutely no complaints whatsoever but for some reason, on the flight back home it was miles apart from the service we had received previously. The in flight entertainment was firstly broken so most of the monitors were not working and the sound wasn't working properly. The food was okay, but nothing to shout about, however the service was atrocious as the staff kept missing me out and forgetting to offer or give me food or drink. The leg room was pretty bad in general, and I got restless alot of the time, but tried to solve that by walking around. However on the flight back there was a lot of turbulence and they wouldn't let people move around so much. Not to mention everyone kept needing to go to the bathrooms and they kept giving out wine, coffee and soda, which of course meant people would need to use the toilets more, but when they tried to the staff would complain about not being seated because of the turbulence. The lights were turned off about an hour into the flight and it made it really hard to feel comfortable as everything was constantly dark the whole way back (13 hours or so). I'm not a fan of the dark in general but it was really disorientating and made it hard to relax as well as eat. The changeover flight from France to London wasn't too great, but this was mainly because it was an old model of plane and I felt every movement the plane took. That may have been because I was so tired from the previous flight and stopover though. Based on the first flight I felt like there were two different experiences and I'm not sure if it was just a bad in-flight crew on the way home, though the in flight entertainment not working was kind of bothersome. I may use Air France in the future based on my first flight but I would hope I would get a better experience next time than the one received on the flight home.","2018-01-25"
"4","Pleasant flight","We were traveling with children and therefore it was great to have a pleasant trip.  The return was better than ongoing.  Except that at Paris the seating at the gate was terrible.  There were so many children on the flight and we wish the boarding was better organised.  Otherwise no other issues.","2018-01-25"
"4","Elegant, friendly and comfortable way to fly.","Right from your arrival at the departure point at Kempegowda International Airport, helpers call to take care of your luggage and direct you to the check-in counters. Punctuality assured. In-flight comfort is very good with full flat bed, large high defifition screen with a range of entertainment, excellent service. Food - light snack and breakfast can be improved - it was better before.","2018-01-25"
"4","Great service, fine food, seating a little tired in their older biz class","This deal from Paris to Jo'burg was a steal when we booked it a few months out making business class a no brainer AND an A380 as well. I had heard mixed reviews about this business class offering and it certainly isn't the best, but honestly one can't really complain. We were due to fly back in Prem Econ but on check in they offered is another great deal to upgrade so we experienced AF business there and back. 

The Paris AF lounge isn't great frankly and we were there for 4 hours. Still, again, much better than hanging around CDG at 10pm waiting for boarding. It takes a long time to board an A380 and frankly the boarding process was a little chaotic and involved a lot of time in a queue. Strangely (since Paris is obviously home to AF) the experience at OR Tambo on the return was much better and the boarding process more efficient. 

Modern intercontinental business class state of the art is obviously lie flat beds with every seat offering aisle access, neither of which is the case here. The seats are angle lie flat and they are perfectly comfortable although one tends to slide down a little when sleeping. Having said that there is ample space and the bed is long when reclined down but the mechanism seems old and although it works perfectly well, makes a tremendous noise doing so as the hydraulics go to work. The seats are 2-2-2 on to of the 380 which means those in the window are climbing if you want to get out when your seat mate is reclined. Not ideal especially if you don't know them or if climbing is no longer your forte.

However these are first world problems. The food is french therefore excellent as is the wine. The IFE is OK, nothing special but quite a reasonable selection in many languages. Not that responsive and the hand held controller works better than the touch screen. There is a ton of space and side cabins to store things so that is all very nice. The A380 is a delight - airy and spacious and very quiet. Both our flights were turbulent so I was glad to be in such a big plane. 

I would fly AF again for sure especially at this price. Not as good as other business class offerings and they know it since I see they are upgrading their cabins. We were very happy to take this flight to South Africa.","2018-01-24"
"4","Friendly and caring crews","Was on this fligh alone,because my daughters took another airliners, our flight was smooth, all the flight attendants are friendly and helpful, I was not feeling good about an hour before we landed, one of the flight attendant checked on me and offered me help, tthree more flight attendants came to help and see to it that I was ok.  I was not expecting the help and care they gave me, I was so thankful for that,even to go my connecting flight,i was being helped and monitored , it was really nice of them, they see to it that I boarded safely to my next flight,Amazing job for all the crews. Tha plane was clean, the services was very good with attentive and friendly flight attendants.","2018-01-14"

"5","Great flight from Houston","We flew Air France from Houston to CDG on to Luxembourg. It was a very comfortable flight on a Boeing 777 with a very art noveau feeling interior. The entertainment offerings and food we great overall. The flight from CDG to LUX was on Air Lux and unfortunately our luggage was lost when we arrived. Apparently this is a common occurrence after talking with the baggage representatives in Luxembourg. We provided our hotel address and had our bags within hours delivered straight to the hotel.

"4","Arrived safe and sound","This short distance plane was not as comfortable as the AF flight I took from Guangzhou but was still fine for the short distance. We were fed a delicious sugar muffin and offered a beverage. The staff were friendly. There was no tv, radio or usb charging port. It didn't materially affect our trip but pointing it out in case you are relying on it. Good inflight magazine.","2018-01-14"
"2","Too many issues","Flew Riyadh to Paris, Paris to Bordeaux via Air France. First flight via Saudia was late leaving and arriving even though all the screens said it was on time. From Paris was the nightmare. The fact that I had the Air France app on my mobile saved me. I went to the gate given upon arrival and waited. Suddenly two disabled people who had been brought by buggy were taken away. There was no announcement orally, nor on the screen at the gate. I looked at the app and it showed that the gate had moved so I went there. I noticed the seat on my boarding pass from Saudi had been changed on the app. The man at the gate told me that the app was correct. I was moved to a middle seat. I hate a middle seat. My reward card settings is clear about this. The flight was very late leaving and arriving. Couples were separated. Some people were left behind.  I understand the original, larger plane had technical problems. However everything that could be wrong, was. Rubbish. ","2018-01-14"
"1","Air France disloyalty to customers","I am very disappointed and disgusted in the Flying Blue loyalty programme. I joined this programme in December 2007, and have used AF a number of times. Recently I have been unable to travel as frequently. My hubby and I booked a Scandinavian trip and requested AF/KLM. At online check in my card number would not register. After we returned, I contacted AF to find out what the problem was. I was told that because I had not flown for more than 2 years my Flying Blue membership had been cancelled. I was not advised of this, and my email address has stayed the same for 20 years. I double-checked all the emails I received from Flying Blue and they all pertained to offers, none to cancellation of membership. This is no way to treat customers, to cancel their membership because they are unable to afford the service. I completely understand that miles expire, but I cannot understand why customers are discarded/cancelled. I will be boycotting Air France and KLM and will be using other more customer friendly carriers in future, even if it costs me more.","2018-01-14"
"1","Just Awful","This has to be the worse airline journey I have ever had the misfortune to use. We flew out with Air Mauritius, which was a real pleasure. Unfortunately, coming back was Air France, which I had never used before. 
To begin with the Boeing 777 was very late taking off, having sat on the plane for about 90 minutes. Whilst sitting there, my legs began to deaden due to a lack of leg room. I am only five feet eleven inches - God knows how anyone any taller manages! The seat was also very narrow compared to Air Mauritius!
Whilst waiting for take off, we realised the three entertainment systems in our seats DID NOT work. This was reported and we were told, 'Dont worry, it will be fixed as soon as we take off'. No chance, we were ignored for the first hour of flight. The next excuse was, 'when the purser has time it will be sorted'. After more and more complaints from us, still no one came. 
Finally, Inthe middle of the night we chased up the purser to be told there was nothing that could be done. We had already realised this and the lack of honesty from the cabin crew was disgraceful!. We were told we would receive an email from Air France and an apology and 60 Euros compensation. Of course - we have not heard a thing from Air France! And anyway, 60 Euros is in no way compensation for such an awful experience. To top it all, even the food was pretty sure. Next time, I shall go back to a journey via Dubai, with a proper airline - Emirates.","2018-01-14"

"2","Not busisness class seats","Our flight from NY to Paris was in Business class with comfortable beds, great service and good food. Then we have another flight business class from Paris to Amman Jordan. Well we were in the front of the plane and the only thing that was business class was the sign on the head rest. This was a 5 hour flight to Jordan and then we had this same flight back on our return flight. I was very sick on the way home. So this 5 hour flight felt forever. Had no leg room, very uncomfortable, couldn't sleep. I wrote to them to complain and haven't heard from them.","2018-01-13"
"5","Professional and attentive service","We have been flying to France every year for the last 25 years. In the beginning we flew with Delta, but having tried a couple of code share flights on an Air France plane, we switched to booking directly with Air France.

For the last several years we selected Air France’s Premium Economy, as it offers more sitting room, as well as semi-priority boarding and better food. These seats are about 30% more expensive than economy, but we felt it was well-worth it.

We finally switched to Business Class and have thoroughly appreciated the difference. With seats that recline all the way, one can actually sleep during flight. The quality and taste of the food is also far above what one normally receives on an airplane. We also greatly appreciate the priority access lanes both in the airport and boarding the plane.

Regardless of the cabin we were flying in, we have always found the Air France flight crew very professional, friendly, helpful and attentive. 

In contrast, during business trips within the States using other air carriers, their flight crews do not come anywhere close to the professionalism offered by the Air France crews.

We whole-heartedly recommend Air France.","2018-01-13"

"5","Now I'll Try Them First","After searching for quite some time on the internet for a premium flight to Bogota, fortunately for me after a few failed attempts to purchase a ticket (the agent had technical problems) I looked on the Air France site I had flown with them before and though they were great, they show you the class your looking to purchase  and the next one up so business popped up and after playing around with my dates I got a great deal flying business. From start to finish it was a great service having access to the lounge really makes a difference and for us (we take kite surf equipment) the no problem attitude at check in was refreshing. The food was amazing in flight and staff were on hand throughout, best of all was the seat, its wide comfy reclines flat, now for me the only way to endure long haul travel pleasantly.","2018-01-13"
"3","Average airline, arrival terminal is excellent!","If you are flying from Oslo to Paris this is the flight you should book. This flight takes you to Terminal 2F which is a very small terminal away from ""hustle and bustle"" at CDG airport. Air France have average aircrafts and average prices. It is a short flight so comfort is not essencial. Just keep in mind that Air France is not a big operator out of OSL, in fact I think this is their only route. This could potentially affect you if something goes wrong with your flight. Remember they are not a member of Star Alliance, but member of SkyTeam.","2018-01-13"
"3","Efficient and professional","Air France is a professional airline that operates efficiently. Their service is as what you would expect from this type of airline and they didn't disappoint. The only thing I was not happy about is the fact that the legroom in business is very small. I don't like having my knees pressed by the seat in front of me. this could be improved in addition to offering wi-fi onboard.","2018-01-12"
"4","Fly the Sky’s ","We drew the short straw and had the middle seats.  When you fly economy you never know what you will get.  The flight staff made it as good as it can get, however.  The dinner menu was fun and the food was tasty.  The wine was carefully described with even the vintage described.  The movie selection was amazing and kept me busy for the entire flight.  ","2018-01-12"
"5","Excellent flight to Paris","For such a long flight, you really want to be comfortable and get great service -- and I have to say even for economy this was a very good flight.  We left late afternoon, on time.  The plane was clean, and the overhead storage was pretty good.  The leg room and under seat storage was very very tight.  The service and food was excellent, as was the in flight entertainment system.  They even provided free alcohol with the meals, such as wine or after dinner liquor.  I would recommend this airline against any american line I have taken on European flights.","2018-01-12"
"3","Check in desk was TERRIBLE!!!","My flight was at 6:30AM from Berlin to Paris, and the last baggage drop off time for my flight was set to 5:55AM. I arrived at TXL a little before 5AM, and there were two flights checking in at the same time (KLM to AMS at 6:00AM). There were only three check in counter opened for 500+ people to check in, and it was chaotic and line was insane without any assistant on site. I just made it to board my flight, and I believe there were many people didn't make it to CDG or AMS. You really need to be there two hours before the boarding.   ","2018-01-12"
"4","AirFrance 6 on the A380 from Paris to New York","This was my first experience with the world's largest aircraft, the A350-800, which flies from Paris to New York.  I took advantage of the upgrade offer to Business Class at the time of check-in just to experience it.  I have mixed feelings about that.  The cabin crew service was impeccable and the food was quite delicious as one would expect of french food, but the aircraft was worn and not updated.  Indeed, some of the seats were frayed, and there was absolutely no wifi on the flight because Air France has chosen not to put it there yet.    Given the size of the aircraft (516 passengers) the large number of business class seats was quite surprising and although the cabin crew's service was exceptional they were kept hopping 24/7.  Too, not all the seats have direct aisle access which is unusual these days.  I'm not sure the upgrade to business class is worth it for a flight of only 8 hours.  Glad I flew it this once1","2018-01-03"
"3","JOON --- Air France's low cost carrier --- was cheap but obviously budget","It's hard to write a review for a 5:30 am flight with a clear memory of details.  The Lisbon airport itself is strange in that gate numbers are not posted until shortly before the flight which can necessitate a long walk quickly to the other end of the airport.

There really wasn't much gate communication but they did enforce the Sky Priority boarding process which was appreciated.  The aircraft is the usual smaller seat pitch of a low budget carrier and they charge for everything except using the bathroom.  I don't understand how Delta/Air France/KLM can include this low budget JOON carrier in a regular itinerary but they do.  Overall, the flight was fairly non-descript.","2018-01-03"
"4","Flight to Bangkok","Short flight from Newcastle to Paris - all good then 11 hours to Bangkok. Seats comfortable, cabin service good and food excellent. In flight entertainment very good with wide selection of new films. Check in no problem and flight connection good as outbound flight in same terminal as inbound, this can be a time issue in Paris Charles de Gaul Airport. Worth the money.","2018-01-03"
"1","Beware of Air France or Delta code share partners","Beware of Delta flights booked through code share partners.
This segment was Booked  flight through Delta, though the flight was an Aur France flight.
A man unwilling to give his name pulled me out of security line and wanted to measure my bag. He was not part of airport security but was employed by the airlines.
Though this roll along bag was within limits for Delta, the booking airline, it was 1/2 inch too long including wheels for Air France.  A fee of 78euros was charged for this over sized bag.
This event was all very haphazard in its execution and felt more like a shakedown in a foreign country.
I will never book a Delta flight where code share partners operate any contained flights nor will I ever fly Air France again.","2018-01-03"
"2","Not the best experience with Air France","My wife and I booked our trip in June. We flew in December.  Flying from Budapest to Miami by way of Paris.  We were told repeatedly to check in at the airport abroad 3 hours in advance. We got to the airport a bit earlier so we wouldn't have any surprises.  Except they don't open their counter until 2 hours before the flight.  

To make matters worse, despite having our ticket numbers, and confirmation numbers, they could not find our reservations.  We had to bounce back and forth between counters for 30 minutes trying to get our boarding passes to be told we will try and get you on standby.  Not the answer we were looking for in a foreign country.  We did ultimately get on board.  

When we got to Paris 45 minutes late, the attendants told us the wrong connecting gate.  When we finally got to the right one, we were the last passengers onboard.  Finally, get seated and on with our 10-hour flight home.  

Upon arrival in Miami, we are waiting for our luggage.  Round and round they go, but unfortunately no luggage for us.  Turns out they left it in Paris.  Seriously....

They tell us that they will try to deliver it the next day.  It doesn't come for 3 days.  To say that it's not a good flight would be an understatement.","2018-01-03"
"1","Lost luggage gone forever","After a cramped flight our luggage never arrived at Tegel(TXL). Lost luggage in another building, few staff to help(we were lucky to have one young man to help us figure out how to work their IPads). People warned us about deGaulle airport and lost luggage---should have listened,. They contract another company(Wisag) to find the luggage and another to deliver it. We were emailed it arrived and on the way then told can't find it. Find another airline to use. Will never fly them again. Will contract attorney when return home. Love French wine and food---DO NOT FLY AIR FRANCE","2018-01-03"
"3","FOOD ABOARD WORST EVER ON ANY FLIGHT","I joined this flight in Paris on the 1st Jan 2018 for a long flight to San Jose. I noticed that my choice of food which was the lamb was given to the lady next to me. This was obviously the last one as the lamb was not available to me. I looked at the lamb dish given to the lady next to me and thought my God that looks terrible, so I opted for the shrimp dish, my goodness it was terrible, I nearly spit it out, so one bite was enough. By mid flight I was really hungry so had what they call a mini burger, not at all nice, but the worst was yet to come. Just before landing on over a 10 hour flight they served a snack, I opted for the pasta. It was hard and stuck together, really disgusting, but I was so hungry that I eat the lot, one hour later just before landing I was feeling so sick, I wanted to throw up but could not as the seat belt sign was on for landing. I fely terrible getting of a flight that cost a small fortune in business class. Who ever thought up that menu needs to be sacked. Bring back the Steak.","2018-01-02"
"5","Excellent service!","It is my first time flying with AirFrance, and surely won't be the last time. The flight took about 10,40 hours from Paris to San Francisco and it was on-time. The cabin crew offered an excellent service. They were very friendly throughout the flight. The in-flight entertainment and light-on/off can be controlled via a touch screen in front of the seat, which is easy to access for everyone. You can charge your phone with USB pot and connect any type of headphones for audio. The in-flight entertainment are great, with movies, TV series and games. I enjoyed playing poker during the flight!
I was also given a blindfold which helps a lot to sleep. They served dinner and then breakfast before landing in San Francisco. They also served ice-cream after dinner.","2018-01-02"
"5","Great as usual!","Air France is and has always been one of my favourite airlines. Even in economy class, service is great, food is delicious and the whole experience makes it worth the price. 

A few details that can be imrpoved: they used to allow economy class passenger to choose their seats. Now you have to pay even for economy class seats.Otherwise, you are randomly assigned, meaning you are not guaranteed seats together. That is definitely something they must change. It's unfair as you are flying economy anyway.","2018-01-02"
"5","Nice service and comfortable plane","The flight was smooth, with great service from the crew on board. The food was nice, with a nice menu with both, vegetarian and regular options. Also included were a wide array of drinks, ranging from Champagne to beer, all included on the ticket. The main disadvantage this flight had was that being a large airplane (800 passengers), luggage takes about 1 hr to come out.","2018-01-01"
"4","Everything went well","Return leg of flight was much better than outbound.  Everything went to schedule.  Staff seemed to care better.  The business lounge was good.","2018-01-01"
"4","777","Awkward leg of long trip, with problems getting clearance to taxi & take off.  We got away over 3 hours late (all of it spent in the seat after boarding - we were not allowed back off the flight) but some time was picked up in flight.  Still missed our connection meaning extra 8 hours stuck in CDG airport awaiting new connecting flight which added greatly to our journey.","2018-01-01"
"5","Nice flight","I booked with Delta and as Air France are in cahoots we flew with these,the food was nice along with the air hostesses.The seats were great as they couldn’t be put back.","2018-01-01"
"5","Bravo!","Flight AF1855 was delayed for 1h 15min. Captain was very friendly and self-confident, when I attacked him with a question and critic about the delay. He explained that it is always the case in Algiers and it is not the fault of Air France. A lot of passengers had to change in Paris and hope all of them made it because the personnel did everything to help the people to get home and their final destination. AF1314 to Zurich was waiting for all 3 passengers from the flight from Algiers. It was very kind, human and professional! The flight to Zurich was almost empty and I was kindly allowed to change my seat, so I could catch one of the last trains from Zurich airport to St. Moritz. As a complement all passengers got a chocolate on the flight to Zurich :) Actually I wanted to write a negative review and ask Air France to learn how to depart on time but they have done a good home work. It was a nice present from Air France that I could be with my wife on new year eve! Many thanks for the professionalism and assistance!","2018-01-01"
"2","Ugh","Ok, I know it’s economy but it was by far the worst economy I’ve ever flown—internationally. WTH, no A/C on a 10+ hour flight? It was the most uncomfortable flight I’ve ever been on. The seats were terrible as well. I couldn’t wait for it to be over. If you have any type of anxiety disorder, UPGRADE YOUR SEAT! ","2018-01-01"
"5","Florence 2017","Great flight with wonderful service!  
I recommend when making your reservations, plan for a minimum of a two hour layover in Paris in order to navigate Charles De Gaulle Airport.  
Wonderful visit in Florence 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹","2018-01-01"
"3","Not what we expected","The flight from Manchester to Charles de Gaulle was late taking off due to a passenger with three kids not having the correct paperwork at the check in gate! Because their luggage then had to be off-loaded we were late on arrival in Paris. The Air France representative managed to whisk 18 of us across the airport and through security in order for us all to catch the overnight flight to Mauritius. The plane was full, the service of the evening meal was slow and the selection of films was not good either! Air France still do not serve ""real"" milk with coffee or tea but a sachet of ""creamer"" in 2017? Even Ryannair and Easyjet provide liquid milk!! On arrival in Mauritius all of the 18 passengers from Manchester had no luggage. However, we were all well looked after by the lost baggage office and our luggage arrived at our hotel the following day. On the return trip the plane was again full and although the in flight evening meal was OK there was still no real milk! Even though we arrived in Paris on time my golf clubs did not make it to Manchester! They arrived 3 days later.","2018-01-01"
"3","Excellent food but crap plane!","Many of my friends warned me that air france is not the best option for travelling, but since I had not flown with them, I decided to take the risk. I have totally regret choosing  this flight. The seats were extremely narrow (I am about 62 kg). The service was extremely slow. The only value for money was the food which was fresh and very tasty. However, if I had a second chance, I would choose a different airline even if I had to pay 50 euros extra. Maybe was just the route which air france serves with crap planes but this is my overall first impression about them.","2018-01-01"
"1","Air France ruined our vacation","Air France ruined our vacation and gave my wife and I the worst new year experience we ever had . My wife and I are spending the new year in Amsterdam with wet clothes and thanks to Air France.

We took the flight from Cairo to Amsterdam AF 503 that arrived Charles de Gaulle at 11: am on December, 30, 2017, and we were supposed to take the connection flight AF1340 to Amsterdam departing 8:25 the following day. We stayed in a hotel that's 5 minutes away from the terminal by train, but to our bad luck, it took the train an hour and half to arrive to the airport due to a problem in the Airport that we don't understand; we were locked inside and we missed my flight :(

Air France staff at the airport were too rude to us. They were not helpful at all. we asked to take the next earliest flight that cost 100 Euros, but they refused saying they couldn't put our baggage on it and when we asked them to send the baggage on a later flight they said that it was not possible.

Finally, they booked us on a 200 Euro flight that was departing 4 hours later. My pregnant wife and I had to stay all this time waiting in the airport and I had to pay 400 Euros (the ticket price for both of us) so that we can travel with our luggage after missing our original flight because of the train issue.

However, we arrived Amsterdam to find out that our luggage are lost. They don't even have an idea where they are. We're supposed to spend our 4 day vacation worrying about our luggage and calling Air France.

To make it even worse, it was raining in Amsterdam at the time of our arrival. our clothes got wet and shops were closed. We had to spend the night in wet clothes and my wife caught cold. She is now vomiting everything she eats.","2018-01-01"
"3","nothing very special, but nothing to complain about also","its just like any normal international flight, but not in class of emirates or even air India. timings are biggest issue for the flight, can't take a nap... leaves late night from India and reaches early morning. the seating has improved a little and better leg space than it was there 5 yrs back.","2018-01-01"
"3","OK for London to Paris, rubbish on long haul business class","We had really good service for the short hop from Manchester to Paris. The meal provide was unexpected and reasonable given the short duration of the flight.

The same cannot be said of the 14 hours from Paris to Santiago. 
The main meal is ordered prior to departure. I really was not in the mood for eating at 12.30am.  There was only one, small,  bottle of water for the 14 hours. It was next to impossible to find any staff overnight to get more. There was the offer of champagne prior to the flight and meal, with nothing else on offer. I did eventually get a glass of white wine, prior to trying to get to sleep.  The movies are the worst I have experienced on any airline. Eventually I found cabin crew to unlock my screen. 

It was impossible  to get a shave . No razor was offered. 

We did get slippers and socks. The noise reduction headphones were a waste of time ( I used my own). There was a pillow, but no covering off the head rest ( yuk!) of the seat.  The flight was interrupted by a string of announcements, not least the closure of the toilet ( and there was only one for the whole of business class on the Boeing 777) some 45 minutes prior to landing. 

They advertised the buffet, which should have been available during the flight- nothing was provided. The breakfast was OK, except neither the wife or I were offered a croissant.  The coffee is very good. 

No priority was given to getting off the plane. We were amongst the queue for immigration - an hours wait. 

I would not want to fly Air France again on a long haul trip of 14 hours. We frequently fly long haul business class and so can make quite good comparisons.","2017-12-21"
"3","always the same. No improvement","The worst of thsi flight/company is the space between rows in Economy.
I could not sit with my knees straight. Although I am not extremely tall (height 1,88cm), I had to travel all the way with my legs bent to one side. It is extremely unconfortable.
On the way back, I travelled with Easyjet and found out that their leg room is slightly better.","2017-12-21"
"1","Paid 4 tickets for 2. Ripped off","A good example how customer service can be a real scandal. 
Booked 4 months ago a claimed promotion for a Paris Buenos Aires for me and my wife for the birthday party of a friend. Found out 2 weeks before that I had to change the return and to transit via San Francisco for business purpose. My wife also had to change then her return. We requested to change and were ready to pay extra but change was denied and we had to buy 2 new tickets.  RIPPED OFF!!!

What really makes me very annoyed 
A. No respect for their customer
When we asked for a commercial gesture, the manager laughed at us saying he had other things to deal than special request

B. Good deal that are not. 
The price we paid our 2nd tickets were 20% cheaper than the 1st tickets. So the reason given justifying that no change was possible is not valid and is abusive

C. Not allowed to benefit for what we paid for
On the way to BA, we therefore had paid 4 tickets. We therefore asked to enjoy 4 seats and a whole row. They refused claiming that they will cancel the 1st tickets to enable check-in. Plane was full so obviously our seats were sold to somebody else. 

D. 
At check-in we requested an upgrade or to transfer the lost tickets in a voucher to be used for another journey in the future. Again, not possible despite our loyalty to this airline (returning from SFO to Paris, I was stupid enough to book with AF to Paris). 

E. Airport tax even not refunded.

If an AF manager reads this and feels the customer service was not normal, the reservation code was UEMEUW for a trip on 23/11.","2017-12-21"
"5","Love Flying Air France","We (a family of four) went on a vacation in France, and of course, flew there by Air France.  We had good experience flying with them.  Food was very good.  They came us with a nice looking menus for all passengers ahead of time.  I think this played us psychologically, getting us to anticipate what would be served.  The airplane was clean.  There were carts full of snacks and beverages for us to help ourselves when we wanted to.  My children had a fun time helping themselves all through the flight.","2017-12-21"
"5","First Class worth it!","What a pleasure to fly like that, private lounge at the entrance of paris airport, 1st lounge to wait quietly, priority lines and access pour customs, and private car to go to the plane!
On the plane a real 180°bed with duvet, amazing meal and service.
The crew take care of you from the beginning to the end outside miami airport.
I recommend!","2017-12-21"
"3","very mixed","The flight from TLV to Paris was terrible the plane was narrow the seats very uncomfortable  and in general the service  not welcoming to say the least. Our flight back was a bit better . From Washington we booked a row with only two seats instead of three ( near the bathrooms but that  helped). On our next leg  we upgraded to an exit seat  . The upgrade was reasonable and at least I had some leg room  - the service?  not bad but not  great.","2017-12-21"
"1","Cancelled at the Gates","This is one of the worst flights I've been on and I travel a lot. I am so disappointed because I fly blue and they have managed to let us down in every . My flight got cancelled at the gate just a few minutes before take off.. The airlines did not give clear instruction to anyone about the cancellation. They promised to sort our hotels and reschedule a flight, but changed did not deliver. (this happened for the entire flight that was cancelled). We were waiting at the service desk in the gate to be served and there was one of the airline representatives gave us really vague instructions to everyone from the flight to go back through border control and into the country to counter number 10, where he said that all of us would receive a hotel and different flights. But when we reached the counter, we were told something else. The person at the counter said that it would have been better to stay at the gate.They also had absolutely no clue about our baggage. We spent about 2 hours trying to find our luggage.All they said was they would recommend us to get the train and did not even offer us any guidance on how to take the train. This all happened with me having a really high fever and I was so ill, at the airport that the members of the staff from the airlines recognised that I was so ill but couldn't do anything to help me. I don't think I need to elaborate any further what a terrible experience I had.","2017-12-20"
"3","Economy class seating at a Business class cost!!","This would be the most disappointing Business Class flight we have ever experienced. It was a 5 hour flight on an A320. The ""business class"" seats were economy class seats with the middle seat of a triple unoccupied. Rather than the female Captain welcoming passengers aboard l would rather she concentrate on Captain type issues on the flight deck. At one time the Captain thought it necessary to help out by replenishing the hand towels in the toilet. Again, not a good look! Overall a waste of money!!!","2017-12-20"
"5","So pleased with my flights","Wow! I was not expecting the flight to be this great. The new configuration of seats in the 777 is 1 2 1. Now that is roomy. Everything terrific: food, wines, comfort. But most of all the service was outstanding. Particularly of note was that the Chief Purser, Karine Toui Tou, was always very concerned for my comfort and pleasure. She exemplified what great service is about. Congratulations to Air France. They have pulled ahead of the pack.","2017-12-20"
"3","Disappointment regarding luggage","I flew from Aberdeen to Geneva via Paris (CDG). The transfer was fairly short in Paris but, upon boarding the onward flight to Geneva (AF1842) we were delayed because heavy snowfalls in Geneva had closed the runway there.

However, despite the delay, I arrived in Geneva to find that my luggage was still in Paris. I was recommended to wait until the arrival of the next flight, as staff were confident my bag would be on it. It was not. The bag was finally delivered to my hotel at lunchtime the next day. 

That apart, it is nice to see that Air France still provides complementary drink and snack on its flights.","2017-12-20"
"1","Flights cancelled","Our flights to Cairo in December 2017 and to St Petersburg in February 2018 were BOTH cancelled. We book flights a long time in advance to make sure we have for ex. connecting plane tickets (in this instance Cairo to Luxor) or opera tickets (in this case Wagner's Ring cycle at the Mariinski). All our plans were thrown into disarray at some cost (taxis, extra hotel nights) but when I complained I received a flippant little message telling me that Air France does cancel flights and please come back for more of the same. This would not be acceptable even for a charter company. The reason one flies on a supposedly reliable airline is because one can plan IN ADVANCE for difficult-to-get tickets. Travellers beware, use a more dependable airline.","2017-12-19"
"1","American Buyer BEWARE with Air France Light fare","We purchased a light fare.  I called Air France to make sure that a carry on was considered a light fare, they assured me on 3 different occasions that yes. I even asked if I could just pay for it ahead of time because we did not want the hassle at the airport. Never did they mention at the airport that they would weigh my lunch, my purse, my bag which had coats and winter items in it.  I tried to remove and just wear my jackets but security was so rude, needless to say 70 Euros later with refusing to let me remove my jackets and throw away my lunch they got there extras.  Then at the gate the AF person was so arrogant and non welcoming.  My travel friend said the same thing occurred with AF the last time with the carry on with her husband which almost made them miss there flight.","2017-12-19"
"1","Lost Baggage on a simple European Two-Leg Trip","Traveled from Marseille to Helsinki for the holidays, Air France had me gate check a small roller suitcase.  Day four since I have arrived and no trace of my bag yet.  The 'World Tracer' that they use show the bag was sent to Saudi Arabia.  No one seems to know exactly where the bag actually is sitting or when it will appear.  I can understand a bag not making the connection, but actually sending off in the other direction to another continent.   I guess they dont know how to use their own computer generated baggage tags. Amazing.

No clothing for the holidays. Merry Christmas to me.  AF641709","2017-12-19"
"3","Premium Economy...Very nice but not for tall people","It looks great!!!. It even looks like a small sized business class, and the area is isolated with an upgraded service, so it seems very promising...until you get to the chair itself. And the chair was real suffering, especially on a 10-hour flight.
I should mention that Im 188 cm (6.2 f) and in order to save space and to lower the price they have engineered a chair that is actually can not be bent back. The chair is actually a hard shelled box and the trick is that the cushion seat and backrest slide forward and seem to give you the feeling that there is more room but in fact it's a very uncomfortable position because the back of the chair remained straight.
The service is excellent, indeed better than the tourist class and not as expensive as the business class. But if you want to sleep on a long flight or for someone above the average height, this is not an easy or even painful experience.
Since I am flying this route quite a bit, and although I can afford the upgrade, I still prefer to fly in regular economy class rather Premium Economy, due this uncomfortable chair. 
My low rating is fir that chair...","2017-12-18"
"1","Non customer centric.","Terrible experience. Flights cancelled twice on same day. After along haul flight. Didn't even provide comfortable stay for break.

I have a Senator status am needless to say i travel frequently.  My daughter and grand daughter were visiting and i booked them with Air France, as it was cheaper than both the airlines i normally use, and now I understand why.  The inflight service on the 17/12 JHB to Paris did not work at all for the entire flight! The crew were rude and ubrupt and my daughter was tavelling with my 9 year old grand daughter.  On arrival their flight was cancelled and they were not given any priority although she has a chuld with her, and had to wait 7 hours in the airport.  When contacting the customer service team, they were rude and arrogant.  When my daughter asked the customer service his name, he told her Air France do what you want","2017-12-17"
"4","Always my favored, in good and bad times!","Although I am somewhat biased against France, I have used Aifrance for work quite extensively over the past ten years to the point that it has become my favored airline, both for business and for leisure trips. 
By flying extensively you do incur in a vast array of nuisances, such as technical problems, bad weather and delays of some sort; what really matters to me is how the company deals with, and solves, them. Aifrance had never let me down … until Tokyo: right then and there I thought that my dear Aifrance had started a steep downhill slide. I am grad to say that they managed to cast my doubts away.
On November 9th our flight AF 0279 to Paris was cancelled; we were made to disembark after 5 hours of extenuating wait for a technical problem that could not be solved and we were endorsed on a China Eastern flight leaving the next morning, accruing a total delay of 19 hours. 
On that particular occasion my partner and I (both Business Class passengers) were not given any assistance whatsoever. We were tired and starved, since during the 5 hours long wait onboard we received no inflight service; they could not operate the ovens because of an electric failure and amazingly enough we received not even water or any other facility.
I did not worry too much and thought that AF, during that long wait, had already taken the necessary steps to reroute us all; but when we reached ground services we were shocked. The personnel in Tokyo was totally incapable of dealing with that situation.
We were made to collect our luggage for which I waited for over 40 minutes as my priority was totally neglected; it was not before I started to show some nervousness that a manager popped out of somewhere and “took care” of business.
At the counter we found an ominous line and very few agents available; skypriority was almost nonexistent  and the line was a slow as a snail; we had to wait three hours to even make it close to the counter. But there was no way of getting any assistance and when 11PM struck (after an Odyssey of 12 hours), my partner finally lost his nerves and raised his voice and I threatened the ground staff to call the police and report them all (and the airline) for harassment. At that point we were finally escorted to the counter.
Next step, new adventure: they did not know what to do. They mumbled for something like 20 minutes about a possible downgrading to Economy Class which we would also have accepted: but the agent was rather vague (to say the least) as to whether AF would have reimbursed the price difference of the Business Class ticket. 
At that point we flashed the monitor of our tablet where we had found (ourselves) an alternate flight. Throughout the day it seemed that they did not want to help us and that they were only trying very hard to minimize Airfrance expenses. We had to insist very hard to be endorsed on China Eastern on the flight leaving next morning.
We then asked for assistance to overnight in Tokyo but received none; the agent told us that it was late at night and all the hotels near Haneda were packed; we might, therefore, want to give it a try on our own, and AF would reimburse the costs. Airlines always have some sort of agreements with neighboring hotels in case of emergency; if they were not able to find one, how could they possibly think I would? And what about the other passengers? 
I had to call my travel agent who, from Italy, was able to find a place to stay (in Tokyo!) that the agents at the airport could not, or did not want to, look for. 
By 11:30PM I could finally grab a taxi to the hotel. I passed by the AF counter where there was an humongous amount of passengers still waiting, uncertain as to whether they could fly the following day and unable therefore to make any arrangement for the night. Meanwhile Thai Airline needed the counters to check-in its passengers and kicked Aifrance aside, leaving it with few available agents; a real nasty mess. I do not know when the last passenger was finally taken care of.
I thought to myself: this is it; I need to look for a different carrier. They are not capable anymore of running an airline. Although it is the fault of the Japanese ground staff in Tokyo, they are working under AF’s logo and AF should probably better select its employees.
I took my time to file a request for reimbursement of all the expenses I had incurred into for the extra night in Tokyo along with a request for damages; I packed it nicely attaching all the necessary documents and invoices sent it over to the Customer Caring in Europe through the web-site one night, at 11PM, after work.
At that point I was not expecting AF to react quickly but they proved me wrong, for which I was really grateful; AF replied the very next morning at 10AM, apologizing and offering the compensation I requested. I have to say that AF customer caring and myself had quite an extensive e-mail exchange after that, to which AF always replied through lengthy, customized messages and the promise to forward my complain to the managers in Tokyo, as the front line there left much to be desired.
Although the restoration is little comfort when your trip is disrupted (but you cannot always avoid technical issues) AF really did its best to make it up to an otherwise very angry customer. Myself, I am just happy that I can confirm, in the end, my satisfaction and loyalty to the Airline; once again they managed, somehow, to deal with the “nuisance”.","2017-12-17"

The sandwich was as tasteless as usual but the worse was my experience with my bag. At the gate, I was asked to give it to them, as they claimed the airplane was full. I did. Once landed in Zurich, the bag hadn't make the trip! The reason I had taken only a small bag was to avoid this type of adventure and here I was without the bag. Poor service.","2017-12-05"

Service levels were what one would expect, food was to usual standard and flight was uneventful . Seating is 2-2-2 and the seats are pretty comfortable although being of an old configuration are not entirely lie flat. Noise level on this plane is exceptionally low. In all the flight was uneventful, as promised and expected and, as such, was very good, but not exceptional.","2017-12-05"

Also had stored snack in medication in there I needed throughout the flight.  This way I didn't need to bother with the overhead storage during the flight. food was descent and crew friendly. Seat could have used a little more padding in the cushion. Only two little things keeping from a full 5 rating is that when I went to check in with luggage in MIA they made us wait an hour before taking our luggage since at that time they where only taking luggage for business class. Also flight did not have the ""pear liquor"" that I have heard so much about. overall will fly Air France again.","2017-12-05"

The hostesses very helpful arranged bags and made more room for everyone else's baggage. In our way to Rabat we passed through several zones of turbulence and one of the passengers -a woman- was in shock. One of the hostess talked to the lady and stayed for a while until the frightened woman was calmed down. That was amazing.","2017-12-05"
"5","business service for holiday","was a business ticket, Air france operated by flyby from manchester to CDG then air face to delhi. return was with KLM. check in at manchester had no priority for business travellers. The connection at CDG was very tight. Once on board, food and service were excellent. Unfortunately baggage did not come off as priority ( a service, i would expect with business class and have experienced with emirates) Return flight with KLM good. Business lounge for KLM in delhi was noisy due to some works. the cabin was nicely spaced ad good ability to sleep. Good choice of films.

"1","Avoid flying Air France at all costs!","Complete chaos at the Air France gate at CDG.  Several passengers asked where the flight gate had been moved, as THERE WAS NO ANNOUNCEMENT.  We walked around to find the new location, since it WAS NOT POSTED on a monitor nor announced via the intercom.  When Air France employees were asked about this at the gate, one of them, in a very defensive, sarcastic tone said, ""we made the announcement, sorry you didn't hear it,""  then completely ingnored the group and walked off.
I have flown most airlines around the world, and have never encountered such a low level of customer service and absolute lack of 'politesse.'  
The food on the flight was abysmal, as was the service and attitude.
Air France must be a terrible airline to work for, as it seems evident in the unhappiness of its employees.","2017-12-05"

"4","Business Class, domestic flight.","The second leg of my journey between Dublin and Lyon.

The Lounge at CDG was average. Very busy so I ended up perched on a stool at a bar for the 3 hour layover. The coffee was nice, but only one machine was operational. The buffet was kept full but as I am ceoliac the only thing I could eat was cheese and fruit and I could not find any allergen information. Staff circulate constantly, cleaning and clearing away, so it stayed neat and tidy.

The flight was comfortable and uneventful. I found the attendants polite and helpful. However only some of the announcements were given in English, the safety briefing and when we took off and landed. The rest were only given in French, so I lost some of it as my French is only basic.

The seat was comfortable enough for business domestic with great legroom. We were served a very nice lunch and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the food and beverage on this flight. 

I take away one star based on the cabin cleanliness as there was stale crumbs jammed between the seat frame and the planes side wall. The rest of the cabin where I was, was clean and neat.

This was my first time flying with Air France and I would use them again based on this experience.","2017-12-05"

Flying is no longer a joy, and barely tolerable. The Air France experience to Havana was the same. It was memorable for one reason though: the worst plane food in recent experience to Paris from La Havana. Chicken feathers in my chicken. Ugh!

Sky Priority check in, luggage, boarding, and security and passport control. Nice, saves a lot of time.
The seats: Lots of discussion on these. The fixed ""pod"" shields you from your front and rear neighbors moving their seats or tray tables. However the seat does not actually recline, it sort of ""slides"" down in the shell. After two trans-continental flights I can say I am ok with it. 
Nice entertainment system, noise cancelling headphones,  lots of nooks and crannies to stash devices and glasses. Plenty of power charging options.

"4","Make sure you get the right seat!","This was the first leg of my trip to Toulouse and the Dordogne. Booked early and got a great fare. Non-stop...thank God! The plane was either fairly new or recently upgraded with the newest entertainment tech...Bravo Air France for having such a great library of media available at no extra cost! listened to several albums and watched 2 recent movies. Paid a little extra to get one of the ""first off the plane"" seats toward the front of the cabin, one row back from the bulkhead, window seat, three across. Won't book that seat again. the row in front was 2 across (small additional fare on top of the early off upgrade and had much more legroom (although My legroom was not bad). the problem was that they were offset and so my tray table, and screen were partially in front of the middle seat and awkward for eating or viewing. It also meant that they impinged on that middle person's space. Would book a row back or spring for the 2 seat bulkhead row. The meals were a bit disappointing and reminded me of the airline meals of years past, although there are upgraded menus you can order from for additional charge which are undoubtedly better. Snacks and breakfast were quite good. I'm no longer a great traveler, but I would have no difficulty booking AF again. Service was very good and quite warm. I would just book a different seat.","2017-12-02"

The Air France lounges are lovely and so are food and drinks, boarding is always through the priority lane and on board you get the personal attention airlines used to give passengers decades ago. We fly economy most of the time except for longhauls to and from Europe and enjoy this airline and even the food in economy.

"2","Travelling La Première and L'Effet Papillon","Friday afternoon. Airport. Nice - France. We were checking in. Flight to Paris, Charles de Gaulle, 6PM. One person in our group was travelling with her Brazilian passport with her maiden name and her American Green Card with her name after she got married. Both Brazil and USA say that you don’t need a new passport or visa if you get married before they get expired. 
So, because of the frequent traveler programs etc (and because it is her name nowadays!!!), her air ticket was showing her new name.
We traveled from Paris to Malaga and from Madrid to Nice with those documents without any problem. Yes, we were flying business…
When we arrived at Nice, we found this lady. I always thought that there are some people that should stay at home. They are clearly not interested in working at all – how could we talk about working properly? 
The lady in the Air France check in said that she couldn’t allow her to check in because the name in the passport was not the name in the ticket.
After we insisted for a while, she decided to check.
By the way, we were travelling with two kids.
Did she call her supervisor using the radio? Of course not! She was not in the mood for work that day. She walked very slow and she left behind a line that was growing and growing.
After many minutes, she came back and said that the supervisor was coming and asked us to wait in the side. It was 4 minutes before the closing time for our flight.
The supervisor came 15 minute later. She was not told about the green card. The lazy creature mentioned to her only the passport. Of course we were right, so she decided to allow us to embark and call the airplane telling them to wait for us.
At the security point, they didn’t allow us to go through as the boarding time was gone. We stayed like puppets going back and forth until they told us that the plane was gone and that they were going to place us in the next flight. The next flight was at 8:25pm. They sent us to the VIP lounge as a way to apologize. I couldn’t help to think how a bad employee that is not interest in doing a good job can cause damage to a company. But it was only the beginning.
The plane was not ok to flight. They were waiting for another plane to arrive from Lyon to accommodate all the passengers. Because we were travelling La Premiere, they relocate us to a flight to Orly. Many people would like to have been relocated as we were. But because of the lady that didn’t allow us to check out in the earlier flight, we were occupying the spots that could have been assigned to another passengers. We arrived at Paris. Our luggage arrived as well, but of course the girls’ strollers didn’t. 
Besides, we had to take a van to Sheraton Hotel at Charles de Gaulle that costs us 120 euros. 
We were supposed to be at CDG at 7:40pm. We arrived after midnight. The kids were tired. We had no strollers that until now were not find. And we were told that the strollers will be send to our home in California. If we don’t get them in 45 days, we can present an invoice and get a refund. What am I supposed to do without the strollers for more than a month?????
Can you imagine how expensive a La Premiere ticket is? 
Can you imagine how much damage an employee like that can cause???
I’m not sure if I will ever travel Air France again. Would you???","2017-12-01"

Attendants were nowhere in sight after serving the meals. Aircraft on the connecting flight from CDG to Lisbon  - trash on front packets were not emptied. Trash was also found on sides of chair. Have flown with AIr France several times before and have never experienced these previously. Having second thoughts on choosing them on our next trip to Europe.","2017-12-01"
"2","I know that things can happen when you go places but...........AF never again","We flew down to PPT on AF and the flight was pretty decent. No issues. You have to understand that the French Polynesian government controls flights into PPT with a vise grip. Really only two airlines serve there AF and Air Tahiti Nui (at least from the USA.)(Yes there is Air New Zealand and Hawaiian - but they do not handle enough traffic to really count.) ATN flies some old A340's that they got on the cheap a few years back. 
It is a real slug of a plane. I wanted to fly AF because they fly 777-200's that can get off the ground more than 1000 feet from the end of the runway in PPT. 
Anyway someone at AF goes on strike. Somebody forgot to tell the French that the Industrial Age of exploiting help ended a few years back. Anyway they scratched the flight but they were kind enough to order up a charter 777 to carry the masses back to LAX. But bad news for us. Not enough room on that 777 as they gave our seat to somebody else or else it was configured with less seats. So I get  a text that they are rerouting us PPT-AUK on ATN and AUK-LAX on American - 17 hours of flying. So I get on Skype and call their customer non-service and get the run around. I go to their PPT office -  ""can do nothing"". So we just have to endure the ordeal. As expected the ATN flight sucked - horrible seats. As always it gets off the ground before the end of the runway in PPT and we got to Aukland on time for our connection. Anyway the AA staff was awesome as was the new 787. The capper was the comment of the AA agent in AUK when we told her about the AF strike - she said, ""AGAIN!"". AA (American) was awesome and rebooked our travel to SFO from LAX. As for Air France - never again.
No service - no follow up from AF. Booooooo. If the French let them stay in business- too bad for them.","2017-12-01"
"4","Good but catering stuck in the nineties","First leg to Paris was very good - excellent seat, adequate choice of English Lang.movies, 777-300ER , very good staff, but food disappointed. In trying to provide 4 courses of food, the quality suffered. Why not spend the same on three courses and get better food. At least warm the rolls! The screen picture quality is also dated. Overall though the flight was very good and certainly punctual. The transfer in CDG was easy and the short flight to Bordeaux was simple and efficient. 
Would certainly use Air France again","2017-12-01"
"3","Good flight, On time","The lounge has been revamped and improved the services offered. Nice and courteous ground staff.
The boarding process went fine, it was off-peak time.
It was a good flight: clean aircraft and nice crew delivering a professional on board service.","2017-12-01"
"5","VIVA LA FRANCE!","flight attendants gave us a big smile the moment we entered the airbus, and pointed us to the seats numbers and asked us if we need anythings just ask them, they spoke both French and English. They are very generous with foods and drinks and pretty generous with carry on bags too. except no wifi available. wish they serve chocolate eclairs, But they did offered chocolate ice creams. Will fly Air France again in a next few years, hopefully they serve eclair is what the French is known for. viva la FRANCE!","2017-12-01"
"5","Friendly skies","Check in was a breeze!  We got there 3 hrs ahead because you can’t predict traffic.  In and out of there in 15mins.  Thought our connecting flight in Paris was cutting it close, 1.5hrs layover, but the counter agent assured us that we would make it.  Sure enough, we did.  Food was typical...nothing to write home about and not terrible, just ok.

Flight attendants were awesome!  We were on time and was able to connect with our ground transportation without a problem!","2017-12-01"
"4","Airline: fine; GDC airport experience: dreadful","First bad thing:  we were unable to select our seats in advance, even though we tried to pay the extra fee.  Don't know why.
The Air France flight was fine, on time, and the food pretty good.  
The schlep through CDG was appalling, however, and I will avoid it from now on.  We had about an hour to get to our next leg, Alitalia to Milan.  The kiosk said we had a 35-minute walk to get to the appropriate gate.  OK.  But what was neither apparent nor ok,  was that for an intra-Europe flight, we had to go through Customs and border control, again.  There was a huge long snaking line, only two agents, and we almost didn't make it.  I will not fly through CDG again.","2017-12-01"
"5","Flight from Boston, Massachusetts to Paris, France","We headed to Paris on a non- stop flight from Boston for a 2 week vacation on Air France Air.  The flight was a smooth flight with very hospitable stewards who were very accommodating to each of our needs.  
The thing that stood out as outstanding to me was the wonderful Air France staff at the airport in France (Charles deGaulle Airport)
who were so helpful getting our luggage ready for our trip home.  My husband’s luggage as too heavy and the staff assisted him in sorting it out so it was acceptable for the airlines. 
We hope to be able to travel on Air France again!","2017-12-01"
"3","Crew great; Problem with luggage was stressful","On our recent trip to Morocco, we were disheartened to realize that our luggage never left Paris, where we connected through from NYC to Casablanca. We were thankful that Air France has four flights daily to Casablanca, so the luggage did make it on the next flight, but, as you may imagine, after flying a LONG time, and then having to chase down the luggage, we were quite frazzled by the end of the day. The whole process took about 7-1/2 hours, which obviously cut into our sight-seeing in Casablanca. A real disappointment. Apparently it is Moroccan law that we had to claim our luggage - it could not be brought to our hotel. (Of course, I guess that is a sign of the times and may be true of all countries.) Thank goodness our Tour Guide with Cosmos, Graham, was able to talk to our driver and took care of the arrangements for us to be transported back and forth twice (close to a 45-minute drive each way).

On a much brighter and more complimentary note, however, the crew both coming and going were awesome!","2017-12-01"
"4","Crossing ocean in economy seats does not have to be terrible","We experienced a round trip flight Toronto to Paris earlier this fall, and I wish that I could recall the type of jets, because as a larger person, I really appreciated the knee space available on the way there, which was definitely lacking on the return flight.  The way the seat ahead reclined was different.   
Other than this, the flights were on time, extremely smooth flights and easy check-in experiences.  The movie selections were very good, with comfortable ear phones.  As with most planes these days, aisles were very narrow requiring service carts to always stop and clear out to allow passengers to pass.
Baggage weight allowance was generous including carry-on.
Nice extra which we purchased, and well worth it, was the lounge option while waiting in Toronto- very nice!","2017-12-01"
"4","It used to be so much better","The welcome aboard was cordial and yes, welcoming.   However, once dinner was served there was no flight attendant to be seen.  From our seats, we had an unobstructed view of the door that leads to the crew's quarters. The comings and goings were impressive, the service...not so much!","2017-12-01"
"5","Starting to love flying","Starting to realize how much of a difference there is between airlines.  So impressed with the quality of service, quality of food and communication when flying with Air France.","2017-12-01"
"1","Don't do it!!!!!","Before booking I phoned to question  the wisdom of a 1:10 minute layover in Paris,  they  reassured me that if there wasn't enough time for the connection, they wouldn't have scheduled it so.     I took them at their word. The connection to Naples Italy was in another terminal with a security check between the two so I got to lay around Charles de Gaulle for the next 9 hours.  I then flew the rest of the way to Naples on a nearly empty plane; however, most on the plane had also missed the earlier on 9 hours earlier because of the impossible connection.    The same thing happened to my wife a few days later.   Before our return flight with a similar layover, I called Air France to get them to change it, they wouldn't do so without a huge upgrade in price.   Together this time both my wife and I missed the flight, this time because of a mid-terminal passport check,  ( it took an hour).  We got on a latter flight for no extra charge but lost many additional ours because Air France wouldn't let us schedule a something that made sense.   I will never fly Air France again, nor will I ever go to France.   This was a Delta Connection, Delta wasn't any help either.","2017-12-01"
"2","Very uncomfortable seating","Paid for upgrade to premium economy and sat in the first row so there would be no one in front of us for the  long flight. The seats were awful. They do NOT move easily and once we did finally figure out how do move them they only moved a very minimal amount, never reclined. Sitting upright the entire trip.","2017-12-01"
"4","excellent onboard service","This is my 2nd time flying to Southern Spain from the Bay area. Flying through Paris was very easy and the service on the flight from SFO to Paris was great even for Economy.","2017-12-01"
"4","always looking for adventure","flight was on time, boarding was efficient, and the crew was good. all in all the flight was good,but they could add just a few inches to the seating and it would be much more enjoyable.","2017-12-01"
"4","Great customer service!","Enjoyed flying Air France because of the wonderful customer service both on the ground and in the air. Both the flight out and the return trip were booked to capacity. The crews were all helpful in accommodating my desire for an aisle seat. The meals were good, drinks were free and every courtesy was offered to all of the passengers.","2017-12-01"
"4","Comfortable flight in economy","We booked flights from Lisbon to Paris rather than paying the exorbitant rates to take a car rental from Portugal to France.  The economy flight was very good value, seats were comfortable with reasonable room & the check in & in flight service were very good.","2017-12-01"
"3","Business/ Affaires","I bumped myself up at GDC and after a rather long “ fast” line through customs, finally found the AF lounge which was packed. Found a seat, had a bite( 3pm) and then started the hike to the plane. The seat is roomy, plenty of space for bags above and beside you. Great movies, music, etc. I still get a kick out of seeing the plane take off via tail camera. Affaires is large so by the time the steward got to me ( he did call me by name as he was holding an iPad), my choice of beef was gone but the chicken was a good second choice. One more time through the cabin for rolls, top a drink, I did not notice the crew...good and bad. I slept a few hours and arrived feeling a bit better for it.","2017-12-01"
"3","Crew soooo bored","There’s a lot of hype about the cocoonlike seat offered. Yes, there is enough room to cross your legs ( good) but the sleep part is less comfortable unless you’re a back sleeper.(I’m not). The only time I was asked if I wanted a drink was when the dinner was served which was about over Boston. I did not see the crew but going back and forth, not stopping or making eye contact, God forbid. The flight was an hour late leaving but we made up the time to lose it as there wasn’t a gate available for this large airbus.","2017-12-01"
"1","""Oh no, madame""!","“Oh no, madame”!
Flight delayed 36 minutes in landing, plane delayed on tarmac, plane delayed further in getting to the gate
“Oh no, madame” – when we asked the Air France flight crew to communicate our delayed arrival to our connecting flight at the Paris airport 
Then we were held hostage, waiting to exit the plane, at the gate.
“Oh no, madame” – when we asked if we could deplane through first class, after watching all the first class passengers exit the craft and the cleaning crew cleaning the cabin
“Oh no, madame” – there are no Air France representatives at the gate to assist connecting passengers
“Oh no, madame” – when we arrived out of breath at our connecting flight and they refused to let us board the plane
“Oh no, madame” – when we asked for an earlier flight to Athens that would allow us to catch our flight to our final destination in Crete
“Oh no, madame” – when we asked if there were ANY flights leaving Paris that would allow us to catch our flight from Athens to Crete
We found a flight with two seats that allowed us to arrive in Athens early enough to make the flight to Crete.
“Oh no, madame” – when we requested Air France to give us our luggage so that we could board our AEGEAN flight to Athens – the flight that Air France said did not exist
“Oh no, madame” – when our luggage was lost in Paris while under Air France’s care. Air France blamed Aegean.
“Oh no, madame” – when we submitted our claim for lost and damaged luggage, missing and stolen items, connecting flight reimbursement. Air France directed us to their USA partner, DELTA.
DELTA has partially reimbursed for the lost luggage and we are continuing to request the legitimate reimbursement for the connecting flight – we will accept a credit to our credit card or a check for $1,100. We have provided the flight documentation multiple times and are more than happy to provide copies of our tickets, again.

AIR FRANCE – after 10 (ten) “oh no, madames”, it’s time for an “OH YES, MADAME”.","2017-12-01"
"5","Always good Value","Air Frace/KLM Are always excellent and good prices. Thhere Business class fares are almost half the price of other major airlines. The business seats are flat beds and the service excellent.","2017-12-01"
"3","Terminal 4 check in","Great Air France Business class flights to Cape Town via CDG Paris and great value but be warned although they say get there 3 hours before for the first flight of the day 6.10 am they do not open check in until after 4.30am and of course you can't go through to the lounge to wait. This should be told as over 1 and half hours standing - very few seats at check in and hardly any time for breakfast in the lounge as they were only just setting up rather spoilt the start of what was afterwards an excellent service.","2017-12-01"
"5","Perfect Flight","Our third tranatlantic flight with our big dog (40kg) and his larger crate.  Reception at the counter at Logan could not have been nicer.  Everyone was very helpful.  The TSA agent who inspected him before and after being put in the crate was great too.  In flight service was excellent.  Food good, drinks free av was good too.  I'm pretty tall 6'3"" and had no issues with the leg room in economy.  Arrival in CDG was very uneventful - except that someone else who had a similar color and size crate was wheeling our dog away as I arrived!  Yikes.   Fortunately it was an honest mistake and when the mistake was realized we all had a good laugh.  AF is great with pets and highly recommend them.","2017-12-01"
"1","Old plane even though I’m on business class ","I was traveling back from Hong Kong and we bought some business class tickets so we could sleep on the plane 

The way down to Hong Kong was so good and the seats were really nice

But when we entered the plane going back we were surprised to se they didn’t have the normal business class seats 

Instead they had a mix between a normal seat and a real business class seat
So you couldn’t take the seat down so you could sleep 

We asked the personal on the plane about this and they said this model hadn’t been updated like all other planes so we were just unlucky 

When I get back in February I want to use my many miles for a new trip. I can’t login and need a new password for my flying blu account 
Now almost a year after I still haven’t used the miles and every time I talk with the support they tell me to wait a few days until the system is up. Well this is just so bad and all year I’ve been flying with star alliance 
","2017-12-01"
"4","Great Service (again) but plane more than a little tired","Flew on a Boeing 777 to Paris but this flight was on an Airbus A340-300. Reasonably maintained but it definitely shows its age. My wife and I both had lower back aches and leg cramps from the worn seats. From ashtrays on the armrests to seats that are literally falling apart it is in need of a complete makeover. Had great seats (20A/B) over the wing for a smooth flight and still had great views to enjoy. Meal service was fair and but again it was the staff at Air France from check in to on board that made the difference. This would have been a far more critical review if not for that alone.","2017-11-06"
"5","A little bumpy to start but great customer service won out!","Booked with Delta (big mistake as that turned out) but Air France did the best they could for us in making this flight a great experience. They worked with us for seats so that we could be together as I was unable to select seats together online prior to arrival. They simply made up for the problems Delta created and even though at the back of the plane and some turbulence the flight was great. Friendly staff and service. Boeing 777 was a good aircraft and no complaints about it at all.","2017-11-06"
"5","Business Class","After reading several reviews for flying international from the US to Paris, France, we decided to book Air France, business class.  Many reviewers cautioned against flying a US carrier overseas and recommended a European carrier when flying to France.  This was the perfect decision for us!  The service and accommodations were first-class!  We received champagne, a travel kit with everything we needed+, a tasty dinner, bottle of water, luxury blanket, down pillow with a pillow case...We boarded, toasted, ate dinner and very much appreciated being able to put our seat down into a ""bed"" position...We both feel asleep right away and when we woke up, several hours later, we were landing in Paris...Since we left the US in the evening and flew 8 hours through the night, it was 10:30am when we landed in Paris.  The fact that we were able to get in almost a full night's sleep meant we did not have any jet lag AND we were able to completely enjoy our first day in Paris...all the way through a romantic dinner and the light display of the Eiffel Tower at midnight that night.

On the way home, we thought we were flying Air France, but the airline apparently partners with Delta and we were placed on a Delta flight back to the US...as fabulous as the Air France flight was to Paris (admittedly we were in business class), the Delta flight back to the US was almost equally unbearable!  Our first mistake was flying coach (although I did read that coach on Air France is quite nice)...we tried to upgrade at the airport, but there were very few business class seats on the Delta flight (Air France had at least 10 times as many seats in business class)...I highly recommend you do NOT wait to upgrade, if you think you are going to want business class.  We were assigned seats that did not recline, right in front of the bathrooms...for a 9 hour flight...there was almost no leg room on the Delta flight...my husband could barely fit his backpack between the seats to get it in the proper ""under the seat"" position for take-off.  The flight attendant DID move us, after a request/plea (bonus points for that flight attendant :)...and while we were able to recline the seats, there still was no leg room and the seats were not comfortable & we were extremely close to our ""seat mates""....Flying on Delta was night and day from our experience with Air France.  Just a word of caution to double check your flights, if you book Air France and think you're flying that airline from and then back to the US...We were not aware that we were on Delta flying back home.  The jet lag coming back from France was one of the worst experiences I've had traveling...I was sick for three (3) days and missed work...would have been well worth double checking that we were flying Air France back to the US...and if not I now know that the upgrade is well worth it to avoid  time off of work to recover from the misery of jet lag, from flying Delta on the way home","2017-11-05"
"5","My favourite airline","Travelled many times, and fortunately many business class flights. Air France to me are the best, very comfortable seats/layout, extremely professional and friendly cabin crew. ","2017-11-05"
"1","Air France CDG Handicapped","Terminal 2E a mob scene on 11/4. I had requested wheelchair service which was confirmed by AF email. If you need a wheelchair, AF makes you stand on the baggage check-in line before you can go to a central alcove and wait again for wheelchair service. I waited on line for over an hour, sitting on family suitcases when I got desperate. AF had 4 check-in agents for well over 1,000 eople. You need the baggage agent to contact the wheelchair alcove, before you stand in line there again to get a chair in which I sat for another 30 minutes for wheelchair service. I only had a back injury incurred while in Paris. What happens to people who just can't stand or walk? 
AIR FRANCE, YOU NEED CURBSIDE BAGGAGE CHECK-IN FOR THE HANDICAPPED AT CDG. Do not use Air France, if you are handicapped and flying out of CDG Terminal 2E!","2017-11-05"
"5","One of the best flights taken...Lots of legroom, many movies to watch and really good food, drinks and snacks","I took Air France on Sept. 22/17, for my second and third leg of my trip to Europe, starting in Montreal going to Paris overnight then from Paris to Prague on Sept. 23/17.   I also took this airline on the way back from Europe leaving Florence, Italy on Oct. 8/17 flying to Paris then to Vancouver, Canada.

On the way to Europe, Air France employees came around and gave us several rounds of drinks, snacks then eventually dinner later on. Being overnight I didn't get the greatest sleep but did sort of sleep and did get fed again early the next morning...I was also able to watch a movie or two before going to sleep.

On the way back home we had received a snack and drink, then flying to Canada which was a nine hour flight and they fed us twice and several snacks and drinks.  Also in this time I ended up watching 5-6 movies.  

These flights were great not just because of the plenty of food, snacks, and drink but because of the plenty of legroom and decent space while sitting, and plenty of movies to watch which was awesome. Also customer service was excellent through all the flights.

One of the best experiences for an Airline of all the Airlines I have taken.

5 out of 5 for customer service
5 out of 5 for legroom and spaciousness
5 out of 5 for In-Flight entertainment
5 out of 5 for food, drink and snacks
5 out of 5 for overall experience","2017-11-04"
"4","Nice flights, coming and going","Pleasant flight despite being in economy. Seems like there was more room on this flight than the Delta flights we have taken in Economy. Crews was great, food was decent, at least edible, beverages plentiful.  Flight was ""on time"" taking off and arriving in Paris.
The return flight from Paris to Atlanta was also good though seat room seemed a little tighter.  10 hours on any flight takes a toll, evidently the airlines are only interested in your money.  The flight crew did everything they could to make the most of it, no complaints.","2017-11-04"
"1","Overbooking","Booked a business class ticket and when I checked in was told I had been downgraded to premier economy as business class had been overbooked. Also was told I wasn’t the only one. The premium economy seat was in the last row seat 23F against a partition wall in the center with 4 seats. The seats do not recline and there is very little leg room. Honestly, this 12hour and 45 min flight was a nightmare and economy looked more comfortable. They give you a half litre water bottle. I won’t be travelling with this airline ever again.","2017-11-04"
"1","Worthless","I am very disappointed in the service I received from this airline. First of all I paid extra for premium economy and was bumped to economy along with a 6 hour change in flight time. Secondly they would not allow us to carry on our carry on luggage that was of appropriate size and under the required 12kg weight limit. That very carry on luggage that had our home and car keys, extra just in case clothing in the event our luggage got lost, winter coats and medications; you know the essentials we need and therefor wanted to keep with us THEN they LOST ALL of our luggage. Leaving us with no cloths, toiletries, medications or coats. They would not refund us for bumping us down to economy, it was a major hassle to get luggage back, went days with nothing. To top it off the customer service was awful, rude and ignorant when we were attempting to figure out how to remedy all of this. Our luggage ended up in a combination of Paris, New York, Minneapolis and Chicago. All at different times. Never again will I utilize this airline.","2017-11-04"
"3","Both Great and Horrible","WHAT'S GREAT: Checking bags in, getting tickets printed, security in Terminal 2F, and customs were all flawless. You never enjoy going through this part, but no complaints. Everyone involved in the process was actually very nice. Kudos to Air France in Terminal 2F.
WHAT'S HORRIBLE: Air France should be ashamed to have crammed so many seats on this plane. They should be paying the passengers who are willing to fly in these cramped conditions for two and a half hours. The lack of legroom made this flight absolutely miserable. Although they did provide a snack, it was really bad.","2017-11-04"
"5","Excellent Servic!","On 21/22 October at 2am I flew from Mumbai to Paris for a conference. the flight was on time and the inflight entertainment was excellent . The food and drinks were delicious","2017-11-03"
"2","Felt Like Economy","The 2 stars is relative to the class and not overall.
I'm no snob but if I pay for business class I want a business class experience and this wasn't it.
It gets off to a bad start when you get to the gate and find half the flight has a Sky Priority pass so you are at the back of a very long queue.
Any queries you may have with a desk person would not be easy as the desk is surrounded by the queues.
Once you get on board it is an old plane, one of the very few left with a 2-3-2 configuration.
Also one of the few airlines not to give you a goody bag, just slippers and socks. I'm not too bothered about most of it but I do want the eye shades.
There are only 4 rows in the main area, with another 1 or 2 the other side of a galley but it feels much bigger and impersonal.
The crew were ok, just not many of them.
The food was good and the wine just about ok but nearly 2.5 hours to get the meal done which is far too long.
Communication via social media is terrible. I had a problem when I got a message which meant no sense and both Facebook and Twitter didn't really get anywhere and I had to ask KLM who were great as always.
The movies were fine as long as you wanted to slash your wrists on the flight.
The bed was ok, though.
All in all it very much felt like an economy class experience.
Back to KLM for me who are a world apart.","2017-11-02"
"5","Relaxing Economy International Flight","We flew Air France for our annual international pleasure trip.  We elected to pay a small fee to upgrade to seats which were two instead of three in a row and believe that was a good investment.  The food was good.  The staff cared for our needs.

We had a tight turnaround in Paris and had not been able to check in on-line because of Madagascar's internet challenges.  A steward on our flight to Paris listened to our concerns, checked to see what he was able to do to assist us, then came and explained exactly what we needed to do to insure we made our connection to the USA.

I enjoyed the movies and quality of the screen system on the Air France planes.  My husband was able to relax and sleep for much of the flight.  I will fly with them again, and recommend them highly.","2017-11-02"
"2","Disappointed ","I flew business from Sao Paulo to Paris and was kind of a disappointing experience given my expectation after flying premium and economy years back. The seat was not I would call clean and the meal menu was simply not given to me although the crew was ok. Its sister company KLM and American have a way better business service, food and entertainment system. ","2017-11-02"
"4","Airbus 380","My first experience of dreamliner. Comfortable flight. Crew was courteous. 
The main economy cabin was nearly full, amazing how the flight was full - 503 passengers.

Need better beverages - both hard and soft drinks variety needs to improve.

They had a tray of soft beverages kept next to the food gallery for anyone to eat snacks and drink as much as they wanted to after the meals were served.
The rear of the plane has enough space for you to stand and stretch on long haul flights. There are 2 toilets and stairs going to the upper deck. I did not venture to see the upper deck.

You need to be nice and tall to be able to access the over head storage bin as it is too high for you to comfortably put your stuff in. Some people were standing on the seat to either put or take out their hand luggage.

The blanket is very light and the temperature in the flight is very cold. Needed another one as I feel very cold. 

AF needs a better selection of movies as the flying time is 11 hours, day time. There was a USB charging port to charge your mobiles if you wanted to.","2017-11-02"
"3","We know better the company traveling economy","Traveling in economy class makes us see how the company actually takes care of its passengers. On the way to Greece all ground staff in Sao Paulo and Paris was very nice. 
The discomfort of the economy class is scary. No one will make me travel again in this discomfort. But the flights were punctual. On the way back to Athenas a very unfriendly land staff. 
In Paris they were gentle, but with discordant informations. I am a silver client and usually have a boarding priority. I went to rank priorities and they sent me to the normal queue. I was in the normal queue and they sent me to the priority .... anyway .... the priority baggage both on the way and the return were not obeyed in NO flights. This is a recurring problem with Air France. Traveling in business class I have made several complaints about this. They gave me reward miles but they do not actually solve the problem. Also, it is difficult to keep your frequent flyer status. Better for Brazilian take AAadvantage or Star Alliance cause we have companies in this two alliances.","2017-11-02"

The crew made a long flight more relaxing.","2017-11-01"
"1","What has happened to this airline?","I've flown with Air France to Japan and Canada  before, and enjoyed the experience. I booked this flight through Delta, whose outward transatlantic journey was served by Virgin (excellent flight) and inbound flight by Air France. I trusted all three brands, so thought this would be good. 

I was wrong. 

The staff on our flight were surely - the attendant for our section in particular. He snapped at my friend when she dared to ask for a headset when he missed her out, and thrust his hand in front of her face as he demanded, 'just wait!' He remained horrid throughout the flight, actually walking off halfway through serving my drink at dinner to look at someone else's television screen and then bring them a drink! I had to sit watching him holding my half-poured drink for several minutes before he returned to me and poured the rest. I am baffled as to what was so urgent he couldn't continue pouring the drink before walking off! 

The seats were ridiculously narrow and uncomfortable. Air France - unlike its partners Delta and Virgin - does not allow you to pre-select your seat EVEN UPON CHECK-IN without paying a further fee of at least £25. We had no sleep whatsoever on the red-eye flight because we were in the middle section and the surly staff member I detail above barged into me every single time he passed, even though I am short and average weight, and was curled up as far as possible from the side of my chair. 

Entertainment was awful, too; barely anything worth watching, with the main draws being several generic superhero movie and over a dozen episodes of The Big Bang Theory. If you don't like childish entertainment, too bad. 

Food was shockingly bad (their website also did not allow me to pre-book a gluten-free meal for my diagnosed coeliac friend), and breakfast was an abundance of processed sugar - sweetened yoghurt, fruit salad, a bizarre apple sauce concoction, and apple pastries. We don't all wake up craving a sugar rush, you know. 

It was absolutely the worst flight I've been on in years. I will never pick a Delta connection which uses Air France again. I don't recognise this airline anymore.","2017-11-01"
"3","Good but not consistently","Overall I like AF and its staff. But don't go with business class on short trips - makes no sense. The only difference is that they leave the middle seat free. Seats are as crammed as in economy and with food they offered no choices. There are no charging stations and no entertainment. In Aeroflot flight of the same length, I was offered a tablet with a lot of movies and a menu with food selection.","2017-11-01"
"4","Long distance with the A380","The A380 is a great aircraft to fly long range, even in economy. Had a good service with friendly staff, good choice of movies, acceptable leg room for an economy flight and smooth ride.","2017-10-08"
"4","A nice trip despite the delay AF-334-business ","After flying many times with Lufthansa, we decided to try Air France. Actually, there was no Lufthansa flight on the day we picked. It was a nice experience: welcoming and accommodating staff, tasty food, good selection of movies...
The only problem was that the flight was delayed by an hour and a half that we had to spend in the airport. We couldn't even plan to do something fun during that time because we didn't know upfront how long the delay was going to be. The announcements went: 20 min then 40 min... until we reached a total of 90min.
It was inconvenient.","2017-10-08"
"1","No luggage!!","Air France managed to lose our luggage on both the way out and the way back, this September 2017.
It arrived 5 hours later on arrival, and a day later on return.
And just because in CDG there was a short transfer time. 
So, if you book one of these quick and convenient connecting flights, dont expect your hold luggage to arrive at the same time.

"4","Good Experience!!!!!!","Travelled with wife and two adult children on a leisure trip. Right from the check-in to boarding the process was quite neatly and efficiently managed by the ground staff. In the air the cabin crew were professional and courteous. Though it was a short flight, the overall experience was very satisfying. Our son uses this airlines more frequently, also for long haul trips and is also of the same opinion as ours collectively.","2017-10-08"
"3","Met expectations ","Nothing exciting - though croissants for breakfast were nice! Check in process quite frustrating at the airport. Forcing people to use the machines just slows down the whole process.  ","2017-10-07"
"1","Worst courtesy experienced over 4 flights, specially for indians","Hi,

I have just completed my business trip to toronto-canada from bengaluru-india. The route was india-paris-toronto and then on return ticket as well toronto-paris-india. So, technically i have boarded 4 air france flights with 4 different crew members hence, I have some observation and experience to rate my opinion on. 

Firts things first, Air france is not a flight for indians atleast. the crew members will ignore you wherever possible, they will be arrogant whereever possible and the courtesy levels will be zero. I have not had any issues during any of my 4 flights, this is just based on the observance and considering that i am frequent traveller and have boarded many other airlines , i could detect the difference. 

The food quality is pathetic with very few options to choose from. Most os the times the captain of the fligth just make annoucements in french and forgot to repeat it in english.

I personally think the inflight crew memebrs are the ones who actually contribute most on how flight experience would end up being. The crew members of air france are cold, arrogant, im-polite and frivoulous. My appologies for strong wording but these are my actual observations and I owuld like my fellow indians to consider all these factors before booking air france flight.

one other incident was when i pressed the call-the-staff button in the middle of the night for water, it stayed pressed during the whole flight and no one bothered to coem over. When I went myself to take the water they informed that we are entering turbulence and if i need something i should just press the button. To this i could ahve just laughed within myself and i did happent to inform them that the button was pressed about an hour ago but as i was expecting from past 3 flight experience they simply ignored that sentence and chose to live in denial.

Please avoid air france flight.","2017-10-07"
"5","Great Airline to travel with","Good, solid airline. Travelled safely and all flights on time. Used the wheel chair facility for my husband. Good communication throughout. Will definitely fly Air France/KLM again..","2017-10-07"
"4","First long haul flight; Enjoyed","Having flown air France before on a short trip between Paris and Oslo that i had nothing much to write home about, this was a way better flight. The only downside is the entertainment especially movies and series. I would however recommend the airline, seat pitch is average but not the worst.","2017-10-06"
"5","On time and secure this is Air France","As usual Air France do the job ,however one thing when deposing suitcases the non wellcome ,the personsaid first :"" The flight is complete"" ,complaining with a cabin suitcase I had  .Is it a way to wellcome passengers ?  I don't know if the Air France staff was Portuguese .....but the lisbon airport is not the best in Europe !","2017-10-05"
"4","Not a luxury environment, but enough to give some comfort.","Flying is always a discomfort, whatever is the class, but the one that is specially uncomfortable is the economic class. Fortunately I traveled in the Business Class, which should be marvelous, but it is not. The seats, which they say can be turned into a comfortable bed, is small for a person not so big like me (1,78m, 90kg) and the air conditioning is always too cold do be comfortable.
On the other hand the food, although not spectacular, is reasonably good, and the flight attendants are reasonably polite. Overall, flying in the business class is not bad, but could - and should - be much better.","2017-10-05"
"2","Will never fly AF again","While the airline had some nice business class features and reasonably comfortable seating the service was the worst especially in Montreal.   The connections they provide in Paris are too tight and you have to clear immigration there which just can't be done in 45 min.   They lost all our baggage on the flight home but they found them and delivered 2 days later.   When we reported the lost luggage a person next to us said they would never fly AF again.  The lady handling the claim told them, ""I don't care.  I have a job one way or the other as they always loose luggage.""   On the flight the service was rude and food was poor.   We saved money flying out of Montreal but will never fly AF again.","2017-10-05"
"4","interesting features...","THE GOOD: the new seat is way better than the old one which was not a flat bed... the inflight food selections was appetizing & was authentically French. Loved it!!!

THE BAD: maybe quite noisy in the cabin even with the privacy windows locked...

TIP: try to sit in front coz it takes 10 minutes of presentation time for each Steward for food delivery so by the time it gets to the last passenger seated@ the end... U would have waited 40 mins for ur turn...","2017-10-04"
"2","Quite disapppointing","Pros:
1.Convenient check-in service
2. Polite flight staff

Cons:
1. seats are very uncomfortable, narrow, with limited inclination
2. Legroom is very limited
3. No head accessories to lean the head comfortably
4. Very limited and not-tasty food
5. No reason to book business class, since the same seats are there, with the only difference, no one is in the middle seats, not much advantage","2017-10-04"
"1","You don't have to buy two first class tickets","My husband and I flew first class Houston to Paris.   In the first class lounge was a couple.  Upon boarding we were all escorted to the plane in Houston.  Only the husband was flying in first.  His wife was in business.  There are only 4 seats on this triple 7.  After take off his wife came up to first class.  They were served dinner and we had to wait 45 minutes to start our meal.  We are paying customers and she was getting first class meal service.  Upon arrival in Paris they were both fast tracked through immigration.  So ok I thought a one time thing. Flying back we were in business on the same triple 7 with 4 seats. There was an older couple in first traveling with daughter and son in law who were in business. I heard immediately when can they come up.  Yep after take off.  They moved all there belongings up there.  So the moral of this story is only buy one first class ticket because Air France with let your family members come up and get first class treatment.  Wish I would have known that!","2017-10-04"
"5","Kudos for Everyone","The round trip flight through Paris and then on to Warsaw was excellent.  We could not have asked more from the ticket agents, flight attendants, flight crew, or baggage workers.  All the flights were early and we had no problem with finding our connecting flights or gates.  To sum it up in one word:  perfect!","2017-10-04"
"2","good food does not compensate for a dirty and uncomfortable plane","My flight AF345 from Montreal to Paris was on a dirty, jam-packed B787.  Seats to narrow, not enough space for your knees, thick patches of dust around the air vents, Also, cost-cutting at Air France did away with hot towels and humid napkins to clean your hands before a meal. The competition on flights to Europe does a better job.","2017-10-04"
"3","Business class should have been better","I usually choose to fly Air France to South America ahead of British Airways, Iberia, etc but a recent trip may cause me to revisit this.  Gone are the days when the Business Class traveller boarding an Air France plane was made to feel special.  This is sad; I recall when the opposite was very much the case.  

Even the staff seemed less welcoming, dare I say a little untidy, certainly nowhere near as helpful.  One individual - perhaps closer to my age than her colleagues - was the exception but for the rest....  maybe Air France's notorious sraff disputes are starting to affect attitudes.

At the end of the day it was a pretty standard journey.  The reclining seats kept failing but when they worked were good, I got a good night's sleep, the films were ok, the food ok but not startling, the drink very ordinary indeed (with some choices unavailable)..  it was okay.  Just ok.  

But should have been better.  Really a lot better for the price.","2017-10-04"
"4","Air France the French Touch with limits","I hope they will stop reducing the legroom.  Fortunately, I had an emergency exit row because otherwise I would be unable to eat or breath.  Air France offers a good schedule, the service on board is good but difficult because they are missing at least one crew member compare to there companies on same flight.  The food is luck, one day good , one day better not to mentioned.  also depends from the departing airport.  I fly them very often and I am only worried because their legroom has a tendency to shrink over time, and when you have to stay at least 3 hours in the plane , they could do an effort to improve this.  Let's see what will happen.","2017-10-03"
"3","Confused","Full disclosure:  We flew one of AF's A380s, meaning the airline is loading 500+ passengers and crew.  While AF's new terminal 2E is a universe better than the old facility, the confusion that surrounds passenger loading is frustrating at best, particularly when some of the gate crew speak broken English. We began the boarding process 30 minutes late -- ""we're still servicing the aircraft,"" which had been at CDG for hours -- and even with biz priority boarding, followed by premium economy, we were herded into a hallway with three boarding doors, only to stand and wait for another 30 or so minutes.  Once what appeared to be two senior AF ground staff went to the elevator at the end our boarding hallway, greeted two white-haired gentlemen with briefcases and escorted them to the upper deck biz boarding door, were the rest of us allowed to board, in no particular order or priority.  We left Paris nearly 90 minutes late. The flight was generally pleasant until three-plus hours out of DC, I ordered a drink, only to be told by the flight attendant I could not be served as US rules required him to inventory and lock down his liquor supply. When I challenged that assertion, I was told ""I'll try business; they have bigger bottles.""  I received my drink, as well as one a couple of hours later which was delivered with no such fuss.  The premium economy seats were very comfortable and the amenities in keeping with the advertising -- unlike our flight over where our seats did not function properly.  With a couple of exceptions, inquiries, etc., were treated with kind of benign indifference, with no sense AF personnel were eager to rectify the situation. Questions were insufficiently answered and delays hardly explained at all.","2017-10-03"
"3","Pleasant flight","The plane was full so I was dreading the flight..however service was quick and staff kept smiling. Food not the best --I was expecting better from a French airline....but I haven't had any better food from any other airline yet!
Toilets remained clean. Good choice of movies.  
One just needs to survive economy class flights and Air France made it tolerable!","2017-10-03"
"5","One of my fav airline companies","Air France is surely one of my fav airline companies, I travel pretty often from the States to Europe back n forth, and I can't complain too much about them. True, the crew isn't always super nice, but what counts the most to me us the quality of the time I have to spend aboard, amd under this point of view I've always been satisfied when I travelled with them. Good food, good wines, good entertainment with a wide selection of movies and music. Recommended!","2017-09-15"
"5","My first choice","Pretty much on time, the cabin crew is very helpful, the food is good and the plane is pretty comfortable. I will fly with them again for sure.","2017-09-15"
"1","Flight cancellation followed by terrible back-up plans","After a very pleasant flight to begin our holiday, the return journey turned very very south shortly before the intended take-off time. The flight was cancelled and it took about 30 mins to get any update from the staff on the ground. Informed to follow the staff member we quickly gathered our stuff but travelling with an uncooperative toddler, bags and a wife who was 6-months pregnant we were quickly left behind - thankfully airport staff were able to point us in the right direction. Approximately 2 hours after the flight cancellation we were booked on a flight the following morning and in a hotel-room 45 minutes away from the airport, with a bus leaving in 90 minutes. There were approximately 45 hotels closer to the airport with availability, but it was never explained why these were not used. The bus organisation was terrible, with a throng of people (more than 1 flight was cancelled it seems) to various hotels all told to go to the same location where there was no organisation in place. Eventually the bus for our hotel arrived 60 mins late and took another 30 mins to leave, meaning we eventually got to our hotel 6 hours after the flight cancellation. Given the availability of so many rooms closer to the airport this was completely unacceptable. I appreciate that flight cancellations can happen at last minute and are hard to legislate for but these are hardly black swan type events, so the lack of any kind of coherent plan for this situation seems like a complete oversight for such a supposedly reputable airline. They lost a number of customers during this fiasco.","2017-09-15"
"5","Excellent!","The plane we were on was huge,  two stories and they provide you with meals, snacks, drinks (including alcohol) free en route to Paris. The food was actually quite good, great movie selection and very helpful stewardesses and stewards. Even the leg room was better than expected for economy class. Would definitely fly with them again.","2017-09-15"
"3","Rude cabin crew","The only positive is that the flight arrived on time. The food was not good and the crew has very little interperson skills. They only want to communicate in French and does not help the travelers. The luggage space above the seats are very small.","2017-09-14"
"3","Flight was excellent but check in and ground admin was a farce","Check in at Heathrow opened on time, at least one desk did, with another 15 minutes later then two more after a further half hour.  People were being pulled from the queue to make their flights in time because the check in was so slow.
Transferring between flights at CDG was frustrating, walking from one flight to another without leaving 'air side' we had to go through security again.
Service on the flight was excellent but the selection of entertainment wasn't great.","2017-09-14"
"3","Missed flights","Transit through Charles de Gaulle in Paris was problematic. Assistance was booked to aid my husbands mobility. Some staff were helpful, others couldn't care both in Birmingham and Paris. Connections were missed because of the speed of mobility equipment and prolonged security checks. On a positive note, the airport took responsibility and rerouted us at no expense. However, our luggage stayed in Paris. It did arrive next day and was efficiently dealt with in Ljubljana.","2017-09-14"
"3","Nice flight, helpful staff, terrible food!","We recently flew Air France Business Class from Paris to Los Angeles;  For a French airline flying from home base the food served was an embarrassment  both to the airline and the personnel who were serving it.","2017-09-14"
"5","Pleasant surprise","I was pleasantly surprised how great the flight was. I had a connection in Paris and as usually expect a delay but it was fast boarding, and take off 2 minutes ahead the schedule. I could take on board a luggage + laptop bag. The flight itself was smooth.  A small cookie, soft drinks and water are served on 50 min flight. The cabin attendants are friendly and smiley.","2017-09-14"
"5","Excellent experience, even with delay","This flight was delayed for about an hour, but the airline did everything to keep as informed about the delay and gate changes. It was fully booked, but despite all these challenges, it was a very pleasant experience mostly thanks to very kind cabin crew who served us snacks and water in spite of heavy turbulence on this short route that particular night. It also arrived in Paris almost on time late departure notwithstanding.","2017-09-14"
"3","Basic but probably safe","I flew from Kiev Borispol to LHR with Airfrance on the 9th of September 2017.
Check-in was easy.
Seating was a bit cramped and cabin service was average and understaffed. There was no in-flight entertainment unless you had your own device and then you could download films etc.","2017-09-14"
"1","My Travel with the not so Friendly skies :(","I have been traveling with Air France for years now.  Every year I travel from the States to Europe, and almost inevitably every year I have a bad flight with Air France.  However, this past traveling experience was one of the worst by far.  My Luggage was lost twice. One when I landed at my destination, and then when I returned home.  I did not receive them until days later. I also had my carry on completely damaged.  To add insult to injury,
the employees of Air France were unbearable to deal with.  They showed very little compassion and had no interest in assisting me with my lost luggage.  I am not going to be traveling with Air France anytime soon.","2017-09-14"

"5","Lovely Trip to Stockholm","This was our first time flying with Air France and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

"5","Better than anticipated","Routing via Guangzhou Paris. They used China Southern on first leg which most pleasant with full lie down seats, only disappointment was CS lounge which extremely hot so moved down to the Priority lounge. AF leg, nice seat, slept all way so unable comment on service. In CDQ just enough time to transfer for BCN. Absolutely value for money","2017-09-12"
"4","VIVE LA FRANCE","As the competition for premium econony hots up I think Air France offer a very good mid range alternative. Air New Zealand, is still, in my opinion, the leader in the pack.

What I like most are the fixed pods so there is no ¨space intrusion¨from the seat in front. I also think the seats are generous in width.  The other big plus is the priority check which does save the bun fight.

I often use this flight and have always found the staff charming and the service relaxed and the food and drink enjoyable for 35,000 feet.  My only criticism is the fact that with the sliding seat you just want it to slide a little and slouch giving a bit of back pan.","2017-09-12"
"1","4h delay. Total disrespect for customer.","Flight was delayed over 4 hours. It happened in the late evening in Paris (their main airport), where they had multiple other planes they could use. Not only didn't they use other available planes, but also refused to pay compensation due to bad weather conditions in Rome, according to their official statement. The flight was between Paris and Warsaw. Apparently the plane was previously in Rome. They could use any other of available planes, so the issue was clearly operational. They refused to pay compensation, which was clearly a misrepresentation. I have already informed appropriate authorities.","2017-09-12"
"5","Excellent value for money","This had a connecting flight but was hundreds of pounds cheaper than the direct flight with Thomas Cook who we dislike. The connection was so quick it didn't make a difference and your luggage was taken to your final destination, so no re-checking during the lay over. The entertainment was very extensive and had new releases (for the uk anyway) and the food was good and we got as much free drink (including alcohol) as we wanted. My boyfriend and I didn't get seats together but once on the flight the crew managed to get us seats together and were very accommodating about it. The crew were great the whole way. We even got a sandwich and drink on the short connecting flight. I would fly with Air France again.","2017-09-12"
"3","Excellent Service, Not Comfy Though","We flew from Singapore to Paris CDG this early August (2017).

By browsing available options, we finally decided to fly by Air France and opted to seat at premium economy class that billed us approximately USD 2000 per person.

Since this is the first time we flew premium economy, we didn't really know what was on the offer.

We were seated at the aisle side that was tight enough to make it rather impossible for us to manipulate our legs. 

We've never been flying Air France economy class, but we could probably speculate these two classes were the same or at least almost the same in term of sitting comfortability. 

It was so tight as to go to restroom we needed to request other passengers in the row to kindly stand up first to allow as to pass by. It certainly disturbed their sleep that they needed during this long and tiring flight.

Luckily the other two passengers were kind enough to stand up to allow us to pass by. It happened at least 3 times throughout the flight. Our kudos went to them respectfully.

Going through this rather uncomfortable experience, on the way back we booked for window seats next to exit door. It was  far better as we could move freely without needing to bother other passengers. As far as legs manipulation, we felt like flying business class really.

The food and beverages served exceeded our expectation, a plus point for Air France. 

Better still, the crews were so friendly and courteous, yet another plus point for Air France.

Onboard entertainments were also varied, making our flight more enjoyable.

The narrowness of the space stands in the way for me to give a 5/5 over all rating.

3/5 will be fair enough to give instead.","2017-09-02"

"1","The WORST airline experience I have ever had--DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM","First, let me say the crew on the flight itself were perfectly fine. I have nothing to say against them or the flight itself. But Air France as a whole is the most wretched hive of crappy, indifferent customer service I have ever had the displeasure of suffering. 

We were moving back to the U.S. with two cats, and after being given false information about when and where to pick up our cats--our family--we ran more than two miles in 90 minutes and barely made our flight in time. In that intervening period, we went from Air France desk to Air France desk and received hardly any help from anyone except for two or three nice people out of about fifteen. Let me repeat that: 2 or 3 helpful people out of about 15. 

The very first encounter set the tone for this nightmare. We approached an Air France desk to confirm the info on our flight and our cats, and once we were told we had that info wrong--and that our cats were left alone in a different terminal in a major international airport--we were then told in the most blasé and dispassionate manner that ""You're going to miss your flight."" So matter of fact WITH NO TINGE OF DECENCY OR WILLINGNESS TO HELP PREVENT THAT OUTCOME. Our experience with almost everyone else repeated this: no help, no compassion. One of them flat out told us there was nothing to do, and then when her manager finally did something (bless him), she sat behind her desk with all the affect of an artichoke. Thanks for nothing. 

Basically, taking out major delays and missed flights, this is, to date, the most horrible airline experience I have ever had. And I have flown many many times. It was so terrible thanks to the lazy, uncaring ""service"" of Air France and Charles deGaulle airport.I've seen better, more competent service from RyanAir. I am never flying with Air France again. Never. I will paddle across the Atlantic on a leaky suitcase before I give money to this sorry excuse for an airline. I urge you, whoever you are reading this, do the same. Book Lufthansa if you have animals. Book anyone else if you don't. But please do not fly Air France.","2017-09-02"

"5","Comfortable seats, ontime departure and landing, decent food.","Air France is a wonderful airline.  We were treated with respect and efficiency both to and from Paris.  We didn't upgrade our seats and sat in the far back of the plane, where there were a few rows of 2 seats together.  We had room to stretch out, both in the aisle and on the window side. It was Boeing 777.  We also took our dog for the first time, who had to go in a crate in the hold.  The personnel were patient and caring with him, and he wasn't nervous or scare, as I was.  It all turned out great, and I've heard of horror stories about other airlines and pet transfer.","2017-09-01"

I had a friend whose luggage was lost by AirFrance and AirFrance didn't refund absolutely anything because she needed to have a receipt for every single thing! Now I had another problem with AirFrance because items in the suitcase were damaged and even though I have receipts, they can't be refunded because the suitcase itself is not damaged visibly. They are trying to put the blame on the nature of the items and how they were packed when I have packed the same items many times before and I have never had them broken by other airlines!! They are pathetic and cheap!!! 30 Euro is too much for them to refund although they wasted me a lot more because I had to pay extra for the transport of that luggage and carry items from one end of the world to the other only so they can break them!!!! Go safe and use another airline...","2017-09-01"

"3","Nothing special - customer service poor","AF customer service in Paris was slow, low quality, & very poor.  Flight boarded early only to be delayed.

"2","Not worth the price","Flew from LAX to PPT on 8/15 and returned to LAX on 8/30.  We booked premium economy to supposedly ensure some added comfort and quiet to the 8 hour, each way, flights.  Yes the premium economy seats are a bit more comfortable than economy seats.  They are about the size of coach seat of 10 to 15 years ago.  However on the flight to PPT my wife's seat would not recline and on the return to LAX neither of our seats reclined.  The worst part was that we were in the last row of premium economy separated only by a curtain from economy.  Immediately behind us was a couple and their infant.  A baby who screamed; not cried - screamed; for the better part of 7 hours of an 8 hour redeye flight to PPT.  Any decent rest was impossible.  Why won't airlines seat those with young kids away from areas where folks have paid a hefty premium for supposedly more comfort and quiet?  Next time we'll opt for Air Tahiti Nui.","2017-09-01"

"4","Don' make the mistake","Realize if you buy your ticket through one of the many advertising airline ticket brokerage companies (mine was JustFly) instead of directly with  the major airlines such as Air France, British Airways, American Airlines you can end of holding the bag. I had to pay an additional $1075 for a new return flight with no reimbursement. This was because I had to push back the return date on my ticket by a week. Also, if you have another airline company in your itinerary (my case Air Baltic) outside of the primary major carrier you lose leverage in making a change. I found there is a universal $300 cost for any change but $1075 hurts! I have learned that many people look at the flights through ticket brokerage companies then book directly through the airlines.","2017-09-01"

"2","Would avoid when possible.","After paying to select seating, our selections were subsequently cancelled.  At check-in we had to show confirmation of seat selection payment before we were assigned seats that were not those we selected.  Food was generally below average with one meal unacceptable.  Flight crew were professional in rendering good and friendly service.  In-flight entertainment offered wide selection among reasonably diverse choices but selection process was challenging.  Ear phones performed poorly.  This was our first flight with Air France and was no inducement to fly with them again.","2017-09-01"
"1","Travel nightmare","Flying Air France Business class from JFK to Orly, Paris embarking upon the aircraft was more or less first come first serve with no order. None of the in flight electronics functioned for the duration of the flight and upon arrival only 2 of our parties 6 bags were found upon arrival. It took three days to receive 3 of the lost bags and Air France sat on these for a full day because they had ""hundreds"" of bags they needed to deliver. We spent the entire 7 days in Paris without my wife's luggage. In spite of being told it would be delivered ""shortly"" day after day, we finally traveled to Orly airport after 4 days where Air France told us the bag was located awaiting delivery. At Orly we were told the bag was apparently in Mali, Africa due to an error in baggage handling. Seriously???? We then contacted American Express global assist in an effort to have some support in this matter. Air France then proceeded to lie to Amex about the bag being at the airport awaiting delivery for the next three days. We leave Paris tomorrow after an 8 day vacation with no resolution and nothing but lies and poor customer service from Air France. Do NOT fly this air line!!!!","2017-09-01"
"4","I always liked airfrance,but the orly airport service I received,was not good,long wait no explanations,but the service","Oh mon dieu,orly...t airport is a mad house,no one helps unless you go to an agent.The wait to go through security was the longest I ever had,not moving,when I asked for an explanation,I was not given a sympathetic reply.The service once on board was professional and went well,the crew was inattentive.Too many crying children,as the flight was full as always.Try to fly from CDG Airport,not Orly. Of course,I'm happy to get home safely,ans can recommend Air France.","2017-09-01"
"4","lovely staff","Needed to get to Madagascar from Europe and Air France is the best option. With a 10hour flight you will arrive the same day you departure. Plane was packed of peoplefeels like each individual passenger has less and less space every time I get on a plane. But all the staff members were delightful, always nice, helping and making sure you were as good as possible. Plus they help sort my seats out during my connection flight and also even offer me ice cream on the plane. Great!","2017-09-01"
"1","Awful!!","I am writing this on behalf of my parents. I am a travel agent and booked them a special holiday to Mauritius from Manchester via Charles De Gaulle on the 19th August. My father is 6ft 6 so as you can imagine he wanted extra leg room seats. We had booked this months in advance and couldn't get a seat plan. I called the tour operator who said that the flight was now a code share with Air Mauritius so they would be travelling all the legs on an Air France plane and you cannot pre-book... I also called Air France who also said the same thing so didn't think anything of it. They were told to add these at check in. They arrived 4 hours prior to departure to make sure of this and when they finally checked in they had seats so far apart and no extra leg room seats were available!! They would have managed without the extra leg room as long as they were together, When questioned at checkin how other people had managed this they had been able to do it on-line that morning. On the flight itself the seats were rock hard, squashed, slow with food and drinks, tatty old planes and extremely slow at getting off the plane. They could only describe this as a shambles. 
They did ask about upgrading but were told very bluntly ""No Seats"" even though premium economy was almost empty. 
They have warned me not to book any customers with Air France again a truly awful experience","2017-09-01"
"2","Left me, a reduced mobility person, without my mobility scooter","I am a mobility scooter user (because of a reduced mobility). On my request, in June, to carry my mobility scooter powered by a lithium-ion battery as a checked baggage (the flight to Paris), AirFrance emailed that I can have this kind of baggage in the hold. But 1 working day before my flight (in August) AirFrance emailed that my battery could not be allowed on board because it has too much watts. As AirFrance left me no time to find the battery that could be allowed on its board or the airline that could allow my scooter as it is, I had to go to Paris without my scooter and hire the one there for 258 euros. So, I filed a complaint via AirFrance online form, asking for a compensation, but got no answer. AirFrance is very slow and reluctant to manage its job.","2017-09-01"
"4","mixed lot","On the outbound journey the service was outstanding the flight attendants couldn't have done more for us they were constantly offering drinks snacks even ice creams it was fabulous
On the inbound journey the service was apalling we were given a drink with our meals and that was all the flight attendents didn't even walk the plane when my husband went to ask for a drink they pointed to a service area near the toilet where sandwiches biscuits and water had been left but had all gone but noone had told us very disappointing","2017-08-29"
"4","Good Flight quick bag drop but not careful with baggage","Check in online was quick and easy.  In the airport printing out the boarding pass and luggage tags was easy and quick.  The only problem was that one of the machines was not working correctly but there was a lady member of staff who was quick to assist.
The flight was only delayed by a few minutes and the time of the flight was good.  Choosing your seats we found was a good option offered which enabled the family to stay together.  During the flight it was pleasant offering drinks etc.  The only complaint would be my brand new suit case being broken upon arrival at Bastia.  This meant I only had three wheels left on my case.","2017-08-29"
"3","It used to be better.","I am used to fly with AF for many years and I have started to notice some services degradation. I believe the pressure for reducing costs is one of the reasons. The airline should find a way to compensate somehow but not with the services depreciation.","2017-08-29"
"3","Disappointing experience","On my personal point of view, the staff of this airline become more careless and impolite than before, which make this trip an unpleasant experience. For ex: one crew member  was always complaining during the service time that kids need to go to toilet, and he need to move trolley all the time, and eventually he refused to one kid to go to toilet, isn't it too much? I had my seats close to the kitchen, so every time somebody is going to toilet, every time they look at you, like you doing something wrong and comment on this, that passengers disturbing them to work or to eat, so build toilets on both sides of the aircraft and passengers will not disturb the crew. Cherry on top, one crew member, become very friendly with my neighbour (because she was also crew from another airline ) and all trip was keep bringing her some presents from air france, extra treats and etc.,i dont think it was very appropriate to give all this things in front of all the passengers, if she wanted  to be so generous, maybe after the flight is over, to make it discreet. And all the trip they were talking and discussing, disturbing other passengers to sleep or to watch movies. All together, i was not satisfied with my trip.

Legroom: I purchased a seat with extra legroom, so i was fine, but in standard economy seat, if you taller than 170cm, it is very uncomfortable.

Seat comfort: I would say, just ok. There are better seats in other airlines.

In-flight Entertainment: ok

Customer Service: as i mention before, was not satisfying.

Value for money:  there is no value for money, i believe there tickets are much overpriced.

Cleanliness: Salon was clean, but toilets, i am not sure they were checking them during flight.

Check-in, boarding: ok

Food and Beverage: Lunch was good, but the bread was not tasty at all, cold and hard. For the snacks in the evening, we were served sandwiches, they were not good, very dry, lots of bread and nearly no stuffing. Also they didn't serve coffee or tea after sandwiches, and when i asked for coffee, they said to me that it is not possible. Selection of beverages is good.","2017-08-29"
"3","Mediocre inflight service and lousy service at CDG airport","Air France did a very poor job of managing their horrific lines at CDG.  I waited 45 minutes to use a self service machine to tag my luggage only to get a message that I would need to see an agent (this happened to several people I spoke to while waiting in line.)  The subsequent nightmarish line to tag my bag took 1 hour and 15 minutes!  The agents at the counter did nothing to ascertain if certain people in line were in danger of missing their flights due to the lengthy wait.  In fact, one agent had no one at her counter and did nothing to actively tell people she could help the next person.  Their casual attitude was frustrating in the face of possibly missing my flight.  Once on board the inflight service was ok but rather than taking the time to walk the cabin and serve water throughout a 12 hour flight, they did this sparingly and instead retreated to the back of the plane to chat and read a book and put out open bottles of soda and various snacks for customers to serve themselves.  They did not announce that they would have snacks or beverages available but you had to discover this by seeing others or going to the WC.   I consider this lazy and unprofessional. Fly Delta instead, their service is far superior.","2017-08-29"
"3","Service okay could be improved","Was my second time flying with Air France and I was a little disappointed with the service this time. They are usually quite good but on this instance the customer service was not up to standard. It felt like they were going through the motions to get the flight service over.","2017-08-29"
"5","Great Flight","Very relaxing , great service, comfortable seat / bed, the cabin staff really make you feel special.","2017-08-29"
"3","Chaotic boarding system and seat assignment","The seat assignment and boarding system of Air France in the flight was disorganized and chaotic. We expected an orderly boarding, but were disappointed that people were not honoring standing in line and airlines people were oblivious to the chaos. Needless to say, it took an unreasonably long time to board all the passengers, resulting in over an hour delay in take off. 

We also flew from Paris to Nice and experienced the same disorder in boarding the passengers. I would be hesitant to fly by Air France again.","2017-08-29"
"4","Regarding airports, still the best option","The flight was punctual and the boarding procedure fast. The on board service is correct and the connection with Garuda Indonesia worked fine.
One negative point is that code shared or sister airlines do not respect the category of your membership club or they very often try to avoid the advantages you can have in one specific category.","2017-08-29"
"2","AF188 Paris Hong Kong","The flight was OK, I did pay extra to get a better seat, food average, nice clean cabin and friendly staff.
The Check In process at CDG 2E was a NIGHTMARE, only automated, with all Asian flights customers totally lost in a hall that looked like a Chinese train station on Chinese New Year's eve. I don't know if this is the responsibility of CDG Airport or Air France but that's a real problem when you fly with AF out of CDG...","2017-08-29"
"1","Poor service","Flight scheduled to leave at 12:30 pm.  Flight cancelled.  Finally got rescheduled to a 8:30 pm flight.  Flight finally left at 10:10 pm.  Was served a two day old yucky sandwich.","2017-08-29"

"5","Loved loved this airline for international flights","Enjoyed our business class seats from Boston to Paris round trip. The staff was very nice the purser on the flight from Boston to Paris was so handsome. He made sure my family and I were taken care of. We didn't want for nothing. On the flight back it was a dream. Loved the staff. We traveled on Air France aug 14 and returned back to states aug 21. The only downside is I left my IPad in the overhead storage compartment. I have emailed and emailed and emailed Air France but no response ","2017-08-29"
"3","The food good but the seats were too small for regualar people","The food is good, but the seats are too uncomfortable to sleep on an overnight flight.  The aisles are too narrow too.","2017-08-29"
"2","Poor business practices","We had to move the date of our return trip because of a medical emergency.  Air France kept changing their response and in the end imposed an outrageous penalty, Their agents kept misleading us throughout the process and were very hard to reach.","2017-08-29"
"2","No wheelchair and no gate agents when we arrived in Paris","I had foot surgery a few months ago so requested a wheelchair. 
When we arrived there was no chair and no one at the gate to ask. 
I walked to the customs line (perhaps a mile) then stood in lines for THREE HOURS to clear customs. 
I complained to Air France and their US partner, Delta. 
Everyone was sorry. 
My bet is nothing was done to fix the problem.","2017-08-29"
"3","WE ARE FRENCH AND YOU ARE NOT","Meal was mediocre and I did not take it
I asked for what the menu called ""A Snack"".  They refused to serve me stating that it was too early in the flight.
I asked to speak to the purser only to be told ""She is sleeping and not to be disturbed""
I didn't see the purser until she bye byed me at the disembarking door.
Although I do business in French in France, the announcements in ""English"" was not understandable.
Entertainment unit was faulty","2017-08-29"
"5","AMAZING PERFORMANCE BY AIR FRANCE EMPLOYEES IN CANCUN","Great service and attention to detail by Mr. Bernardo and Martha at the Check in Counter in Cancun.
They make seem an overbooking and then cancelling of flight like a walk in the park! Professional, courteous and always with a smile.
Kudos to all the Air France personnel at Cancun Airport.","2017-08-29"
"3","Premium Economy - disappointing","Aircraft was clean. Personnel on ground and on plane were very courteous, personable and professional.  I had purchased a meal and it was very good. I had purchased a premium economy ticket for my turn flight and I was very disappointed in the comfort of the seat.  It proved to be very uncomfortable.  I have since flown in premium economy on Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge and those seats are far more comfortable than those on Air France.  The Air France seats have a much more ""designer"" look to them but there is no comfort.","2017-08-29"
"2","Business class and service that was so lacking .","worst service i have ever experienced .. no personality and you had to ask for everything more than once .Empty water bottle left on the tray all night ..Coming in to land and thanking people for flying and walking past empty plates still to be collected .

"2","Annoying experience","An annoying, tiresome experience. Staff refused to speak English, minimal, impolite service. Flight attendants very obviously didn't like their job - a shame because this isn't the customers' fault :(","2017-08-29"
"1","Puh, tough business class experience","Service was minimal, drinks for lunch, after that there was no service any more. Food was the worst I have ever tasted, spend the rest of the remaining flight hours with stomach aches :(","2017-08-29"
"3","Ill timed flights but the airline made good","Our flight from Nantes to Charles de Gaulle airport was delayed.  We might have made the connection except for the ridiculous queue at Passport Control.  There must have been 1,000 people in line with 6 passport agents.  About 20 of us missed our flight by less than 10 minutes.  One would have thought they would hold the plane for so many of us.  We then waited over 1 1/2 hours to find out what our options were to get home.

While Air France's processes seem cumbersome, they at least put us up at a nearby hotel which was clean and comfortable.  We had vouchers for dinner and breakfast and 15Euros for food in the airport.  Also free bus transportation (which was great except it took us ages to find the bus stop!)  My phone activity monitor said we walked (and sometimes ran) over 2.5 miles that day.  I guess that's good!","2017-08-29"
"3","Crew not really interested just getting through doing their job","So for a flight leaving at 11:35 pm, that is a night flight, the crew entertain themselves by serving an elongated dinner for 4 hours making sure nobody can sleep. The dinner was not good. and the breakfast bad as well. The seat was badly designed and uncomfortable when lowered into a partial bed configuration. During the night the crew did nothing to turn off TV screens pointing away from the seat of the occupant into the eyes of adjacent passengers further keeping them awake. It was like the crew din't want to be there. Announcements in English were made but with such strong accents that they were not understandable. Air France has in the past been much better - maybe it is just this route they don't like.","2017-08-29"
"4","out on a limb...","as a gold Star Alliance traveller, this was a reach to the opposition and i went to the airport early to ensure minimal drama. And there was none...well almost. Check in was straightforward (with actual person behind desk) and checked bag sailed into the belt just as easily.
Flight was pleasant, staff professional - not overdone. Landed @ CDG ontime and walked happily towards baggage until....whole area was shut down - not a soul in sight, just the bags wandering in circles from our glass wall vantage. As numbers (of people) grew, tensions rose and no info didn't help - assumptions of security situation were made. 

Then very thankfully after about a quarter hour, an attendant came and unlocked the doors and we were hot, but through, our bags arriving 5 minutes later - the relief was palpable - less an Air France issue than a general one where liminal, stateless spaces (airports, stations, hotels), can these days assume all manner of horrors....all good - merci AF!","2017-08-29"
"4","Great Flight, services good and on-time","Flight was 8h long, but entertainment was good. Service and food were ok. Nice Flight . Air was full, but boarding and drop off was easy.","2017-08-29"
"4","Professional Care","Air France was recommended by Pauwles Travel and we were not disappointed. Another reason had been that my husband had asked that we never use Transat again. The plane was clean and maintained during the flight. The service and food was good. Another plus was that the crew were just as caring on the return flight in contrast to Transat where the crew seem to take a holiday. 
The monetary bonus to Air France was in the free blanket, pillow and eye mask handed out on the flight. The pillow is small so carrying one's own may still be wise.
Perhaps the difference was the personal seat space when inches count so much. 
With these benefits we did not pay more and got a discount of hundreds of dollars compared to other airlines. 
In the past year airlines have made headlines for the wrong reasons but I  have booked a flight to Italy with Air France in the confidence that we will be as comfortable as possible in our budget.","2017-08-29"
"1","Flight misery","The flight experience out to Lima from Amsterdam with KLM had been great - comfortable seats and good entertainment and food. However the return trip with Air France was the complete opposite. Seats were cramped and the entertainment system was temperamental. A 12 hour flight in a cramped seat next to the window got worse when the plane diverted to Martinique to offload a passenger. That added 4 hours to the trip, with no additional food on offer or even drinks being brought round. The stewardesses did leave some drinks in the kitchen areas, if you were able to leave your seat and help yourself, but were more concerned about getting their own break times rescheduled than making sure passengers were looked after (they obviously didn't care who overheard their conversations!).Whilst the Air France staff at Paris airport were superb at rescheduling missed connections, the flight crew and their service was appalling. I didn't sleep at all during the flight due to toothache and would have welcomed an occasional drink during the long hours when there were no staff to be seen.","2017-08-29"
"4","Sir France still offered 2 seats on side of plane","We were still able to get 2 seats (one window, one aisle ) without being forced to sit next to a stranger for the long trans Atlantic flight., something I really appreciate. Food was decent, wine very good. And alcohol also available.  Would prefer more English language movies. Glad I made choice for air France .","2017-08-29"
"3","Better than previous - but still not great","On this short haul flight Air France was not so bad. I  really would not recommend them though for long haul flights. All of my previous long haul flights with this carrier have been appalling - poor service, uncomfortable and cramped seating, just bad in general. Strangely, the seats and the legroom on this short haul flight were both superior to their long haul equivalents.","2017-08-29"
"5","Every thing is perfect, it was business class, service beyond all expectation, perfect.","what I had mentioned above , it was great, I always use KLM from amsterdam-Cairo,
because the company stops flying this line, I had moved to Air France, which is perfect

"5","One of the best","We used to boycott Air France years ago when service was non existing. However, on our last few flights started last year (after a friend highly recommended), we have changed our perception on them. The service and food in Business Class have been amazing. Seats are more comfortable and bigger. Great inflight entertainment! Flights have been on time, the transit in CDG 2F to 2E are so convenient. Thumbs up!","2017-08-29"

"1","Delay and unrespectful treatment","I had to fly Helsinki - Lisbon with ticket from Air France and from Lisbon to Madeira with another company. Air France jet had 2 h and 15 min delay and because of this I missed my flight Lisbon - Madeira. At the airport in Paris I talked with the staff at the gate who were representing Air France. At the moment of that conversation the flight had 1 h delay and noone told us what's the reason for the delay, nor anyone told us how long it is going to take. The staff asked me for my ticked; when they realyzed that the the flight I was going to miss wasn't included in the air france ticked they said: ""Sorry, we can't help you!"" I explained I was goint to arrive late in the evening in Lisbon with no flight nor accomodation, they said I should go to Air France office at the airport and tell them my situation. When I arrived in Lisbon the air france office was already closed long time ago. 
I had to cope myself everything. Accommodation and the new flight came on a price of 500 Euro. I wrote an official complain to the company. The answer was that it was all my fault and I should be more careful when book flights and make longer gaps between the flights (as 2 hours wasn't enough for next flight at the same terminal). Zero compensation and nothing provided for more than 2 hours delay.","2017-08-29"
"4","Flight on time","The flight was pleasant, and it departed on time! The service on the plane was good, and the food was also good.","2017-08-29"
"5","One of the top airlines","The duration of flight in each direction was so reasonable including very convenient connection at well organized CDG Airport in Paris. The main meal was very good. Especially, red wine from the Pays D'Oc region.","2017-08-29"
"2","The return was not good at all","Strike on Air France staff from Lyon to Bastia,so we had to stay one night in Roissy and take the flight for our final destination the day after. I was asking for a compensation in April but STILL WAITING FOR A REPLY FROM THEM !!!!","2017-08-29"
"5","Business class, the way it should always be","Yes, it was brutally expansive, but, at least, we have had the service and comfort expected from business class. New cocoons, great food and wines, perfect staff. First class business cabin.","2017-08-29"
"3","Three point five","A little bit above the average. The seats are good, the entertainment as well. As a economy class is not bad. But not so different of the most popular air lines.","2017-08-29"
"4","Normally Very good, Failed computers at airport, delays, no luggage and useless compensation in return.","As a frequent traveller between Morocco and the UK I am generally happy with Air France (until something goes wrong). In which case they will answer you quickly on Twitter and send you a DM but then not react very well to a complaint. On the occasion in question a computer failure in Morocco meant a manual check-in was needed. Sadly this didn't get into full swing until 2 hours of standing in line with no information provided (not Air France's issue directly). I then missed a connection and was put on the next available flight which was a reasonable reaction. I arrived in LHR with no luggage, even more frustrating given I got back on the same plane. My luggage was returned the next day and after complaint to AF I was offered 80 Euro voucher. Up until now it all seems OK. I have since tried using the voucher and it appears totally useless. I cannot use for seat upgrades or anything done after the original purchase of a ticket. 
On the plus side the planes are new and clean and the in flight crew are always pleasant.","2017-08-29"
"4","Good service","We had a good flight.
Check-in was a breeze since we were considered priority passengers.

I use them, only because I have subscribed to a membership program and because they have the bast offer in terms of number of flights from Paris","2017-08-29"
"3","The check in at the airport is not very well organized","It was a real hassle to check in at the airport as if the machine check in has issues, the staff is not very helpful. I have selected Air France because of the flying times, as I was flying with young children and didn't want to have very early morning flight, otherwise I could fly cheaper with budget airlines and they are somewhat similar in services.","2017-08-29"
"4","Great for last minute flights, lovely service","I needed to get to London quickly and was happily surprised that the prices although last minute were very good and I even got Sky priority boarding. Always a smile, great service and refreshments served. Lovely airline and they get it regarding customer satisfaction.","2017-08-29"
"3","Herring effect","Air France = boarding disorganization  + overbooking problem / be careful!! Planes are ""always"" full . Seats are as closer possible from each others => so you are considered like a herring !","2017-08-29"
"5","Outbound great, inbound not so great","These were just short flights, only about 90 minutes each way and nothing out of the ordinary regarding the actual flight.
Air France however do seem to have a problem with in-flight catering.  The outbound flight served breakfast, coffee & croissants which was very nice however the inbound flight served, er, some weird sandwich type product which, although claiming to be a cheese sandwich, was not something that you or I would generally expect to be categorised as ""cheese"".  I believe it was some sort of mixture of sheep cheese, chilli and who knows what else, mixed into an orange paste and then plastered into the middle of a bagel.  Judging by the number of ""sandwiches"" returned my taste buds weren't the only ones that didn't approve of this culinary oddity.
I can only assume that Air France use a completely different catering company for their flights into the UK and whilst their more cosmopolitan travellers may appreciate such offerings, it was quite clear that UK families returning with kids from EuroDisney, didn't.  We'll be making our own sandwiches up next time ;-)","2017-08-29"

"5","Family trip","Very high standard of customer care, comfort and general service. Perhaps slightly more expensive but refreshments are included and there is no annoying announcements urging you to buy stuff, so typical if so-called budget airlines.","2017-08-29"
"4","experienced travel above economy","Tried this class to try to get a better nights sleep than in economy.
We had the 2 seats on the window side of the isle. We had space, a storage locker  below the window, a leg rest. The seats reclined within their own space so the person infront did not intrude into you space. I found the seat back needed the usual cushion to make it comfortable and unusually my husband had to do the same. Did I sleep any better - no but that is me. I was certainly more comfortable and being in a trow of 2 we had easy access to the isle. Would probably use this class again if money permits. The crew were french (not surprisingly) and were nothing like as attentive as their Dutch counterparts on the outward flight.","2017-08-29"
"5","Premium Economy, the only way to go.","We booked up with Air France through there website, this was the 4th time we had flown with them to Saint Martin. On all the other flights we flew economy, but this time the price for Premium economy was only £100 more each, and we saved a lot more than that flying out on a Thursday as opposed to flying on a Saturday. Big problem with the leg from Manchester to CDG, our flight was very late landing so it really was a sprint to get to the gate. They were just about to close the doors, but happily they let us board the plane.
 If you can upgrade to Premium Economy the do so with out hesitation, what a difference. so much better. It's a long flight to the Caribbean and going Economy drives you mad with ignorant people reclining there seats so much you can hardly move. None of this in Premium Economy. The seats are pod like and as such the back does not go back, the whole seat slides forward in the pod, great idea. The service was great as there are only around 25 seats in the dedicated Premium Economy section. Plenty of leg room too. 
Some say the seats are very uncomfy, we did not find this to be true. The 9 hours just flew by. This is a much more relaxed flight, not squashed in tight. 
We flew back Econamy and this just reinforced my thoughts on the flight out. We will always try and fly Premium Economy now with Air France. You just need to choose you days carefully.","2017-08-29"
"4","London to Dubai","Flew with the family for the second time from Dubai to London via Paris. At peak travelling time this is a great cost effective alternative (half the price) and less than two hours more journey time.

Clean aircraft with great service","2017-08-29"
"3","Meal service nneds to be improved","Flight was comfortable but disappointed on only one meal service on the Paris Tana leg. Was glad I took my own snacks. Further food was available but not served and not announced. became a free for all self service in the galley! Lack of alcoholic beverages and choice was disappointing. It seems that Air france has cut their usual high quality service on this destination.

Paid extra for fast exit at Tana but plane disembarked from both ends of plane so ended up queuing at immigration for 1.5 hours, so negated effect of extra payment.

Return legroom was worth the extra though.","2017-08-29"
"4","Travelled With Air France Many Times & Always Consistent","My husband & I have travelled to this destination & other Greek islands, many times & always with Air France. We have never been disappointed with the service & prefer to travel with this airline if possible. We are traveling with them once again in 2 days time.","2017-08-29"
"3","Huge wait for luggage","Waited over 30 minutes for luggage which came 20 minutes after the expected time. 4 different flights due to arrive on same carousel .  A mass of people....CHAOS","2017-08-29"
"3","Air France,  or Error France?","We flew to Europe on ALM and had excellent attentive service. Not so on this flight from Air France.  We hardly saw the flight personnel.  I ran out of water and finally had to go run down someone sitting in the back of the cabin.  I was told to sit back down and someone would be coming through.  Two hours later I went to first class and got a bottle of water.  Guess if you pay $3,000 more per ticket, you cenexpect better service.  We were fortunate to get for $250 per ticket extra, the seats behind a wall that had extended leg room.  Only draw back was everyone used it as a walking lane. The food was not exciting at all.  When we were in France, we ate at several small sidewalk restaurants and had excellent food, and the people of France, where ever we went were ver nice, helpful, and friendly.  The others work for Air France I guess.  It gets them out of the country for a while. If I had my choice, Air France would be the last air line I take.  Trash pick-up was only twice in 11 hours.","2017-08-28"
"5","Excellent flight - on time.","My first time on Air France: great service, the food was better than any flight I have taken.
The attendants were excellent; they could not do enough for us. Smooth flight with no problems getting luggage. Would use them again definitely.","2017-08-28"
"5","Amazing Customer Service","We arrived at the Paris airport late and Delta Airlines cancelled connecting flight and booked us on another flight to Oslo with a connection through Copenhagen.  This after an overnight with no sleep.  We were so lucky to have spoken to the most considerate Travel manager with Air France.  He was on the telephone for over 30 minutes to try and get us on a direct flight to Oslo - which he did and we flew out only 4 hours late.  I wasn't terribly impressed with the Paris airport but this gentleman went out of his way to help us and for that I will be every grateful!","2017-08-28"

"5","Very pleased with overall exoerience","We flew for the first time on Air France this year and were pleasantly surprised.  This our 7th year in a row flying to Europe and must state that this was probably one of our most enjoyable flights   The staff was excellent and meals were good.  Sometimes we have found that the food  is not even passable and that the airline wants to charge extra for everything.  All in all, will not hesitate to fly Air France again ","2017-08-28"
"5","No issues at all.","This was our first time on an international flight and not sure what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. We were traveling with an elderly parent and the airline staff were very helpful. It was nice to get a full meal on the flight. They offered all types of drinks at no cost. Each seat had its own TV. They provided headsets to everyone. The flight staff were nice. They spoke multiple languages.","2017-08-28"

"4","Extremely surprised! ","I was apprehensive about my flight due to the reviews that I had read after booking however I was extremely pleased.  The flight from Manchester was delayed 10 mins however this was relayed to passengers.  The flight home was delayed approximately 40-50 minutes whilst sat in the plane however this again was relayed to passengers.  
Cabin staff were extremely polite and courteous.  Both lift off and landings were very smooth and drink and snack was offered both ways; would fly again.  4 stars for the delay","2017-08-28"
"5","Upgraded to economy plus  at no charge  a  lovely  surprise","when we arrrived to check in at Charles de Gaulle the ground staff  told us our baggage tags were not printed properly from our home printer .We were told to go back and print them at airport check in a machines . to our surprise the machine spat out two upgraded boarding passes , to economy plus, with our new baggage tags . We did not even ask and there was no charge .","2017-08-28"
"3","Really Lousy Coordination Between Departments","We arrived at Logan Sirport several hours in advance to reconfirm the need for a wheelchair in Paris.  All taken care of in ticketing at Logan, request confirmed, and boarding passes noted. On arrival in Paris, told to wait until all passengers disembarked and then ...... No Chair!  We missed next flight and again, No Chair!  On return flight, finally got a Chair, but it took 2 hours!

Business class service on-board was okay, but nothing to rave about.  The printed menus were nicer than the meals.

Poor value for the money.  Thank heavens the rest of France was great!","2017-08-28"
"5","Great service terrible terminal ","Had a great flight from Paris to JFK terminal 1. Like a zoo. No clear directions lines were out of control.  PANYNJ unapologetic.  Was embarrassed as there was a large group of French students who had to endure  the non citizen line which was worse than the US citizen chaotic situation.  Sad ","2017-08-28"
"5","Nice group of flight attendants from French Polynesian","I will only rated the return flight from Papeete to LAX. I have used AF flights several times in the past, when I travel to Europe. This past July, I used AF again for my round trip LAX-Papeete-LAX. The group of flight attendants on my return home flight were hard workers. From men to women. They were pleasant, they worked so hard and always smiled during the 8hours flight. The flight was full. It was a jumbo jet, it was at least 300-400 people on board. Yet, the crew served our meals at no issues. Every time i used any restroom, they were all clean and tidy like I just step on the plan. I fly a lot, international or domestic. The longer than 5 hours flights were always unpleasant when came to the restrooms. Either shortage of toiletries, hand soaps...etc and dirty..Not this AF flight. I talked to the head of the group. She told me that this group all came from Tahiti.  They were friendly, helpful and hard at work, and best of all they kept those restrooms so clean. This crew group deserve a 5 star of their services. No delay in take off.","2017-08-28"
"3","Watch Out for Added Fees","Second time flying Air France. First time had to pay additional fee at Nice airport because ticket was booked for child instead of adult (no indication on actual ticket or at time of purchase). . This time I was connecting on an international flight but had to pay to check bag (within weight limit). I had called AF before I left Newark re baggage fee and was told there was none. After I checked bag I was pulled aside to weigh my carry on and purse.  Combined weight was 3 kilos over so I was now asked to pay 80 euros. When I complained that I could have transferred items to checked bag fee was waived. Last time for AF.","2017-08-28"
"5","Service and food was incredible, seriously airplane food! great flight","1st time flying AirFrance. Excellent service and you could see everyone was comfortable and taken care of. Leg room was great. Sure beats Westjet... you are so cramped in and can't move....","2017-08-28"
"5","Kind service","It's such a pleasure to be treated kindly. The flight attendants go out of their way to...attend! They rise above the standard ""I work for this airlines so I have to pretend to be nice"" attitude. You really feel genuine friendliness.","2017-08-28"
"2","Worst customer service","We travelled from Tampa to Atlanta to Paris to Barcelona. Originally the flight was to be Tampa, Kennedy, Barcelona but the Originating flight got delayed. The actual flight on Air France was lovely. However our luggage did not arrive in Barcelona and the nightmare began. It lasted three days. Multiple calls to AF resulted in a rep reading from the same script every time. We asked for a supervisor and were told there was none. When they finally located the suitcase which was at the airport, an hour away, we were tol it would be another 24 hours to get it to us. We explained on multiple calls we were headed to a cruise and insisted.  Again it took multiple calls to get the luggage one hour prior to cruise departure. Do NOT fly AF. We fly a lot and that experience was horrific. Worse, not a single apology.","2017-08-28"
"3","If only my bags could have traveled with me","AF0006 CDG - JFK Airbus A380 Business on 8/26/17 and connecting in CDG 2F to 2E hall M

I love my checked baggage.  It carries all my stuff, rolls effortlessly, and never complains.  But I suffer from separation anxiety, and when my baggage goes missing I'm inconsolable.  So when I checked my bag in Marseille on August 26th, I anxiously awaited our reunion in New York later that day.  Little did I know, Air France had other plans for us.

When my wife and I booked RT tickets to Provence earlier in the year, we booked direct into Nice on Delta and then home from MRS via Paris CDG on Air France.  I was looking forward to the business class return on the A380, and ignored the fact that the MRS - CDG flight was in economy.  The itinerary said ""business"" so I figured we'd at least get priority boarding and maybe a seat between us.  Air France gives out one boarding pass to cover multiple flights, and since our first flight was all economy, there was nothing on it that indicated SkyPriority, an issue that would come into play in Paris at passport control.  After a long ground hold in MRS,   We landed in Paris about 40 minutes late and hustled over to our New York bound flight. We had about and hour, and  I had read that the connection from Terminal 2F to Terminal 2E could take 30-40 minutes, but figured that was an exaggeration.  Its not, and its actually more like 60 minutes minimum.  French passport control was a disaster, the line was hundreds deep.  Apparently many arriving flights were delayed.  Despite only half the control booths being manned (lunchtime??) the line was moving, until one of the orange vested line monitors announced ""if you have a 1:20 flight move to the front.""  Apparently everyone behind us did have that 1:20 flight and mayhem ensued, queue barricades were breached, and a mosh pit formed.  I've never seen anything like it outside of Naples (semi kidding).  We did finally get through, ran to the gate as final boarding was announced, and then sat on the plane at the gate for another hour.  Travelers should be warned that due to increased security in the Schengen area these delays are common.  Other than the lack of communication and direction, I don't think AF is to blame.

In contrast to the connection process, the flight to New York was terrific.  The business class cabin on the A380 takes up 2/3 of the upper deck.  Compared to the Delta 767 we flew over on, the cabin was spacious and comfortable.  The seats are comfortable for sitting, the AVOD is pretty good with a large screen (but fairly meager selection of films).  The food was timely and very well prepared, as you'd expect on Air France.  The toilets are huge, and there is a self serve drinks bar in the galley after the meal service. I chose this flight because the top deck is quiet and the AF food and service is great on a daytime flight.  However, be warned that as comfy as the seats are for sitting, they are angled flat and I find them difficult for sleeping.   Supposedly an upgrade is coming in the next few years.   One last interesting thing is that there are live cameras mounted on the nose, belly and tail that can be accessed on the VOD.  Its really cool to get the pilots eye view of the landing.  

So, about the bags.  After a quick trip through Customs and Immigration in JFK with GOES, and we headed to the baggage claim.  Turns out the delays out of MRS must have caused AF to place our bags on a later flight.  The fact that they ended up having 2 hours to make the connection did not seem to matter.  Luckily, Delta's app sent me a notification, and when I checked the bag status I realized that the bags were on AF10, not AF06.  We waited in line, filled out the paperwork, and were told the bags would be sent to us that evening.  They were not.  The next morning,  I called AF baggage service and was told that the bags were actually on flight 356 arriving at 4pm that day.  Turns out that is a flight from Paris to Toronto.  Now  I'm nervous and a little confused, as the night before we did get an email from AF that the bags arrived at JFK.  As I'm on hold with AMEX travel looking for help, I get another call, which turns out to be our bags in the driveway.  

So its a happy ending, but the fact that AF baggage did not know where the bags were, that they could not get them on the right plane with a two hour transfer, and that they could not communicate any of this in a timely manner detracted from a pretty nice flying experience.

"2","Poor Customer Service while Checking In","Extremely rude airline personnel while in line to check-in.  My wife and I were chosen randomly to have our carry-on luggage weighed.  We had no idea there was a limit to carry-on weight.  This is the only airline that we have ever flown that had weight restrictions on carry-on luggage.  My wife's bag was over the limit.  The Air France attendant would not allow us to transfer some items out of my wife's bag to mine to redistribute the weight since mine was under the limit.  He rudely said that we would have to pay $50 and sent us to another counter to pay the fine.  Fortunately the Air France attendant there was much nicer to us.  He saw that my last name was French as we are Cajuns from South Louisiana.  He waived the $50 fee.  We spoke in French to him and thanked him profusely for the kind gesture.","2017-08-28"
"2","Not Priority","I am highly disappointed in this airlines premium economy offerings. I booked a round trip flight from Chicago to Dublin on Air France and can say the whole thing was no better than flying economy..at almost double the price. I purchase premium economy for the perks; boarding first without being rushed or scrambling for carry-on space, a comfier seat and ample leg space and usually a better dining experience. The website listed perks that were indeed not offered.

The check in process is fairly easy and can be done in ample time, up to 7 days before, if you are traveling internationally. They also offer cheaper upgrades close to the flights departure and for $300 more I could have upgraded to business class but only for the first flight as connecting flights somehow become a separate ordeal. I decided against the upgrade as I wanted to try their premium offering first and regretted it. At O'Hare there was no one to check my bag and I had to do it manually myself, printing out the tags that say priority. A perk of premium economy was supposed to be you would get your checked luggage first but this did not occur on my departing or returning flight.

Both flights were late, boarding began almost an hour late and the flight attendants proceeded to rush everyone so the flight would not be departing more than 30 min late. On my return trip the plane was late and instead of boarding at the tarmac, we had to brave bus and rain, which threw priority boarding out the window and resulted in another late flight. The entertainment console on their plane is outdated, most didn't work and/or the touch screen is non-responsive. The seat leaves A LOT to be desired, I am only 5'3"" and didn't think there was enough leg room, nor is the recline comfortable. 

The food was okay, nothing really to write home about, just slightly above standard airplane food. I did enjoy the complementary bottled water already at the seat and amenity pack, as the socks were super comfy. I think I would fly Air France again but only to try out their business class","2017-08-28"
"4","Overall excellent flight for long haul 10+ hours. Paid for Coach upgrade, worth extra room.","Premium economy was worth extra $$ except cabin section became overly warm for unknown reason. Curtained off 6 rows or so betwixt business and coach.  Much cooler in other sections...
My tv console did not work for movies/tv, even after attendants kindly re-booted our section, but otherwise great flight, especially onboard camera showing forward view of earth from aircraft... which did work for me.","2017-08-28"
"5","Wonderful International Flight to Athens","Overall our seats, service, entertainment, food and beverages were outstanding! Definitely go the extra mile and fly premium economy if at all possible- it's well worth it! We were very comfortable in our first row seats and were able to stretch our legs during the long flight. Also, we enjoyed the delicious meals and complimentary wine. We would undoubtedly fly Air France again!","2017-08-28"
"5","Great service, on time, great amenities.","Great trip - comfortable. Staff attentive. The staff has the timing down to a science. Special requests were taken and carried out. Lady across from me spilled wine on her blouse and three attendants quickly provided club soda, towels, etc and then cleared a washroom for her to change.","2017-08-28"
"2","Least likely to book again!","Not impressed. Couldn't check - in online. Unable to make changes to seats online. Unable to change seats at gate. Tray table dirty. Flight attendants rude. Lost my food allergy restriction which meant no meal. Provided customs form in French only. Note the customs form is not required for US citizens. Book elsewhere.","2017-08-28"
"5","Voila!","Excellent from start to finish. My wife was recovering from surgery and all AF staff went out of their way to be of help with wheelchairs, seating, customs etc. The A380 is huge but very comfortable and quiet. All meals were very good, of course, they're 
French!","2017-08-28"
"4","Business class on Air France was very comfortable and worth the price.  Service and comfort was excellent","Excellent service and reclining comfort.  The chair reclined to be almost flat.  Pillows and blanket provided to encourage good sleep.  Stewards very attentive. Food selection good.  Several good wines and champagne.  Toilet very clean.  Entertainment ok.  Liked classical music Chanel very much","2017-08-28"

"3","Save Money to Cayenne - Fly Coach","I flew this route twice, once coming into the French Guyana and once coming out. On the one route I flew coach, on the other I flew business class. The seats are the same in each class of service, but in business class they don't sell the middle seats. I would just as soon fly coach on this route. It's a short flight and they did not sell out coach so I had two empty seats to stretch out. The flights on both occasions were late. Service was okay in both sections of the plane. You get a meal in business class. My biggest complaint was that Air France canceled one of my flights and then rescheduled me for two days later instead of putting me in coach and having me fly later that same day. I had to work with my corporate travel department to get on the next flight instead of waiting.","2017-08-28"
"3","Not impressed","With the high price I paid for the flight with Air France from Chicago to Paris I was expecting much more.  I flew with two small pets in the cabin and while I will say that the staff were somewhat pet friendly, they were not helpful when I ran into difficulties.  Overall I found the staff professional, but not friendly in any way.  I would not want to fly AF again.  Also the legroom and space in economy was the worst I have ever come across.","2017-08-28"
"2","Can not sit together when booking through Gate1","Flight to Europe booked through Gate1.  Air France would not let us book seats until we got to the gate, so of course there were no seats together.  We did a lot of calling and were always told this is the deal.  I really like AF but also like to sit with spouse.","2017-08-28"

"3","Avoid DeGaulle","Flight was OK but Charles DeGaulle Airport is a MESS. Air France boarding process is disorganized and unprofessional.","2017-08-28"
"5","What a difference from US airlines!","We booked our flight to Paris on Delta but it was a codeshare with Air France. My only possible complaint is that the overheads are smaller than usual but since we checked our bags it was no biggie, justice aware if you plan to do carry-on. BTW: no charge to check bags (""No charge, sir, this is Air France!)

Seats were comfortable despite being in Economy, seat back entertainment was of good variety. The standout was the service and the meal.

Start with complimentary champagne. Choice of two very nice dinner selections with wine. Then, instead of dessert we were offered cognac instead, also complimentary. Breakfast was light and French. The flight attendants could not have been more professional and polite but also friendly.

I would absolutely fly this airline again given the opportunity!","2017-08-28"
"3","Not a Great Ending to a Great Trip","The flight out of Barcelona was delayed because of weather. We missed the connection in CDG to DTW and had to stay the night. The re-routing was difficult from finding the right desk to change the flight to getting to the hotel. However, our luggage ended up staying in CDG for an extra two days and then when it arrived home, several items were missing. Air France did make good on most of my claim, so I give them kudos for that!","2017-08-28"
"5","Best flight we've ever taken","This flight was perfect.  We sat in the exit row at the front of the coach cabin or the lower deck.  The flight attendants were AWESOME!  So friendly and helpful.

"4","Paris to Nice","Flight from Paris Orley to Nice was nice and very affordable - only about $50 1-way. The trip back to Paris was high-speed rail which was also quite comfortable and pleasant.","2017-08-28"
"5","Premium Economy is worth the extra bucks...","Both going and coming -- outbound on an A-380, back on a 777 -- Air France's Premium Economy class was very pleasant indeed. Slightly more roomy seats, a smaller dedicated cabin for that class (although on the A380, where everything is huge, it was fairly large), nice entertainment system, a bit of quiet, and really good food -- it all worked for me, and represented good value for money. You can order an extra-nice dinner, if you wish, for about US$20 or so, and it is well worth the added expense. At the CDG end you get access to the express lanes for security, passport control, and the like, and that is a real benefit as well. Madame and I are planning another trip to Paris -- this one for pleasure -- and have already booked into Premium Economy for that one. We're looking forward to it --","2017-08-28"

"5","Wonderful Flight with Excellent Service and Entertainment","The flight was extremely relaxing with great options for entertainment, decent in-flight food, and a bonus with beer and wine included in the cost. The flight was smooth and arrived on time. The staff were friendly and no issues arose during the flight. I highly recommend the Air France flight between Dulles and Charles De Gaulle.","2017-08-28"
"5","Smooth trans-continental flight","This was one of the best airlines I have flown with over the past five years. Everything from the check-in, mobile app, and in-flight service was top notch. I would highly recommend Air France to any person traveling within Europe because they are consistent and have a great staff.

I flew with Air France three times during my trip to Europe and was not disappointed with anything.","2017-08-28"
"4","Be aware of your connection times at Charles de Gaul (CDG) Airport!","Booked flight from LAX to Lisbon and return. Web page allowed me to book return flights (which makes it what the airline considers a ""legal"" connection) with only an hour and 10 minute layover at CDG. Trust me when I say this is not physically possible to accomplish this.  Between immigration and security lines, mass amounts of people all funneling into two escalators to get down to the interterminal shuttle trains it was painfully obviously I was not going to make my return connections. Stressed over this for few days and finally called AF customer service. Spoke with a very nice lady named Jennifer who took over an hour with me exploring options and helped me to rebook giving me adequate time to make the connection, I'd have bought her a drink when it was all said and done for going that extra mile! The flight attendants were all very friendly and helpful, sorry however can't say the same about the gate agents.  Saw them treat multiple folks with a great deal of distain when they asked questions....
Upshot of this review is do not believe an airline web page that will let you book any connecting flight at CDG without at least 2 1/2 hours to make your connection, trust me. And if you do anyway, can't say you weren't warned 😏","2017-08-08"

Though Charles DeGaulle airport could do with an expansion and better information and co-ordination at customs. The aeroplanes were roomy and clean and the food quite good. Especially, flying back from India to Canada, there were a few storms mid-flight but the professional crew and pilots made it feel routine and safe.","2017-08-08"
"1","Avoid this company!","This is the worst air company I've used. Crew is just simply rude, what is more they were hiding bear and wine. When I asked them for a bear, a stewardess gave it to me with a face as if she had to pay for this. Food is not varied and what is worse they just put bread on a dirty tray, even without a napkin. It's just disgusting. What is more, apparently it's a self-service and when you call a crew member he/she just ignores it. Additionaly,it was like in a freezer during the whole (long) flight. Last but not least, crew speaks mostly French and not willingly switches to English.","2017-08-07"
"3","Ok airplane, B 777, ok seats with, etc, a minus to service. After Emirates it was like comming from a Mercedes to a Lada","The food was rather average, can barely remember what we had to eat. No choices. The flight did not carry stronger spirits, just beer, wine and a liquer that tasted mostely sugar. And they were empty on the plane a little over half way to the destination! What a blunder!

The selection of in-flight entertainment was ok, but the screens were rather small. half the size of my last Emirates flight!

Airfrance wase a huge disapointment and stood up as a cheap, 2/3. - rate operator. Shame!
The staff was ok, from what options thay had to offer, though.

Flying back with KLM was a totally different experience. 2 choices of meals for dinner, cognac, whisky, everything. And smiling, gentle and happy crew!","2017-08-07"
"4","NIce connection between plane and train","This time I have been in the Loire Valley in Tours. Although tours has a small airport you can't reach it by plane from Paris, so you will change in Charle de Gaulle airport to the TGV which brings you comfortable to Tours in nearly 2 hours. The train didn't  go to Tours 
trafic station directly. It held 5 km outside the city in Saint-Pierre-des-Corps, so all had been a small adventure. The flight in business from Francfort very comfortable because there the middle seat is not occupied. Excellent small warm food and good French wine. In Paris airport you have to  pic up your train ticket for the TGV but it is not so complicated at all. As always a wonderful experience with Air France specially this change to the TGV.","2017-08-07"

"1","Never Flying Air France!!!!! ","This airline is probably the worst airline I've ever traveled in.
From the minute we walked in, the lack of common sense is not all there. 

1. I was not able to use the electronic kiosk (even though I checked in online the night before).

2. We checked in our two luggages, and had our personal bags as well as a carry on with us, to go through security. Once we were walking through security, my husband and I were pulled over and made us weight our personal bag WITH the carry on, the maximum amount is 16kg (35Lb) my carry bag alone was 35Lb, so they made us get out of the line and was told to go make a line at the ""express"" check in. No one seemed to know where that was so they told us to make the line again at the help desk. 

3. Charged us €60 for each carry on and they set our bags aside and was not placed in the conveyor belt like the rest of the bags. 

4. Plane was very small. 

5. The airline missed placed 2 out of our 4 luggage (along with 25+ other people from the same plane that didn't get their luggage). Once they located our other two luggage, they said both would arrive on the next plane (1.5hr later after we arrived). We waited at the airport for those luggages and only 1 came through. We complained to the airline and they guaranteed us it would be on the following flight (4hr later).

6. Air France was not accommodating at all after being on the phone with the air line and speaking with lost luggage in Venice. They said they would delivered it to our hotel 24-48hr later after it arrived, but we were skeptical as they kept making false promises to us about our luggages. 

We wasted our entire day as we waited for our bags to arrive. 
This airline would be my last resource if I have to fly. ","2017-08-05"
"1","bad service","I was flying from Atlanta to Paris last December 2016. My seat was on aisle and when I was on board I noticed that next to my left had been seated a large US man that his anthropometrics were out of the seat standards (5th & 95th) limits of populations. His body shape was out of the seat boundaries. When I made a complaint to the cabin crew firstly for my travel comfort and secondly for the cabin safety in case of an emargency evacuation, nobody could help me and no any seat was vacant. So I had to travel 8 hours over Atlantic next to a large man without any comfort.","2017-08-05"

"1","Do not waste the money with Air france ","Out flight was supposed to be non stop to Paris. Two days before flying we got a text: ""due to operational reasons flight will make a stop at Caracas and will depart earlier"" You just can't believe how they do this. And today, more than 30 days after the flight, I still have no answer to the complaint I wrote. Still wondering what does: ""operational reasons"" are?? Cheaper fuel in Venezuela maybe? (we did stop for fuel!)  We had to wait longer for the food. I travelled with my family. So we got earlier to the airport, and guess what: airplane didn't departed earlier, waste of time! Bought expensive tickets, to fly in a VERY old plane, first class bathroom is horrible! Quality food was not good, we expected something different. So next time won't bother, just buy real business class tickets with another airline. ","2017-08-03"
"2","Booking changes","We had a nightmare trip home to Brisbane! The flight service was fine, however the company themselves changed the status of one leg of our flight home 48 hours prior to our departure without notification (we had confirmation documents from our travel agent). The error would have been picked up if the assistants at the Charles De Gualle airport had listened to us! Instead they did not read our travel documents properly and had us departing the flight in China! I would never trust this airline with our flights again, it was a very stressful time! I would like to say that staff at Guanghouz airport were fantastic, they helped us negotiate new flights and had us on a flight on the same night!","2017-08-03"

"2","Nasty air hostess","Racist air hostess called Camille was rude and nasty to me on my flight from Istanbul to Paris this morning. She spoke down to me and was aggressive in her tone. All I asked her to do was take my son's food tray away as he had finished eating. She had this horrible look on her when I asked her politely with a smile and she replied, ""I was eating my food, you could have waited five minutes."" Then she snatched the food tray from me and stormed off. I spoke to her Manager and her Manager spoke to Camille and then reported back to me that Camille would come to me and apologise. I was absolutely raging as she had humiliated me in front of people on the flight. How dare she!!! She forgets that it is people like me who pay her wages. I was not psychic to know she was eating her food. She could have been more polite and explain to me rather that get into a heated rage and humiliate me like that. Disgusting service. She did not come to me during that flight even though over an hour remained. Her Manager spoke to me again before we were about to land and asked if she had come. I said no. She said she would log this down and I said I would be making a formal complaint and requesting a full refund. No one talks to me like that ever! Wouldn't recommend for such horrible service. She was nice to others. Nasty towards me, maybe due to the colour of my skin.","2017-08-02"
"4","Back from Bordeaux to Charles de Gaulle","Definitely better flight on our way back, the boarding was well organized, the flight was late (45 minutes) due to a radar outage at the tower.  The service due to the small length of flight is limited, cookies and beverage.","2017-08-02"

"1","My experience with Air France","Every year, I fly from Istanbul to Lima to visit my family with KLM. This year, due to unforeseen circumstances, I booked a flight with Air France. I thought that as KLM and Air France were close partners, the service, entertainment and food quality would be similar, if not better. I was wrong. The entertainment system, which I do not think had more than a hundred movies, would not work, even though the flight crew restarted it multiple times. The unhelpful flight crew told me that as many people were using the system at once, this could happen. The system is obviously very old, and in urgent need of renewal. Needless to say, I could not watch anything on this 12 hour flight.

The food was on average, if not bad. The flight crew were unhelpful and disinterested on solving my problem. I do not recommend Air France to anyone looking for a decent flight.","2017-08-02"

"5","The best First Class experience","Had the opportunity to travel from London to Hong Kong (via Paris), in First Class with Air France .
Hands-down…This is the BEST First Class experience I have ever had. The inflight service was great, with only 4 seats on the 777-300. But the quality of the ground services (escorts/ limo direct to plane/ lounge) were absolutely amazing ;  a LOT better than FC on other airlines like.... Cathay, Qatar, British, Singapore and Lufthansa!","2017-07-09"
"1","Don't fly airfance / DON'T believe what they say","Me and my husband were in a flight from firenze to rio with connection in paris, airfrance in firenze had a delay and we got in paris in a rush and finally when we were at the gate, we and another couple was not boarded! The airplane was still there, people from the flight was still walking to get inside, and people from airfrance didn't do NOTHING to try to board us!!! We flight from 20 years at least once and most of all 2 times for europe per year, even above 2 parents of mine died in AF447 Sonia and Ferdinand Porcaro!!!! The airfrance people didn't gave us a dinner or some sandwich to eat, didn't gave us any higienic/personal use, lie to us that the morning flight for sao paulo is full, lie to us that  we could do all of this (dinner/ higienic/ remark the flight if have some how to go to sao paulo) at the hotel, give us a voucher to sleep at the hotel, a lunch at the hotel and put us on the same flight at 23:30 today! So after all we still have to wait 24 h to fly... in the end we will be in Rio at 6AM completely tired to go to work, with an important and urgent meeting and a class to run at university. A SHAME TO BE TREATED LIKE THIS!!!!#airfrance","2017-07-08"
"5","""THIS IS THE WAY FLYING SHOULD BE""","First experience with Air France and it was a good one.

Has 4 seats in the middle but row 43 has 3 seats And the tv screens are fitted poorly and in all truth unless you turned your head to the right or sat at an awkward angle you could not watch anything on this 8 hr flight!!","2017-07-08"
"3","Air France - Premium Economy Very Disappointing ","We booked this flight on Air France in Premium Economy as it was a special deal, much cheaper than the airlines we would normally travel on. Now I know why the low airfare was being offered, as the Premium Economy section/service on Air France is simply not worth paying extra for. 
I fly Premium Economy solely for the extra leg room, which actually can make long haul flights tolerable. On Air France, the amount of additional leg room, from standard Economy, is minimal, hardly noticeable, meaning you are stuck in a cramped position for the duration of the flight. Also, the meal service is the same as Economy section, even the plastic cutlery. No welcoming drink or hot or cold towels when you board the aircraft. To make matters worse, on boarding our flight in Hong Kong, all set to push off, the Captain came on and announced that due to heavy storms over the Himalayas, they were not permitted to depart and that we could be waiting 4-5 hours before the aircraft could depart. We ending up sitting 4.5 hours on the tarmac. When the Captain said he had ordered the drinks service to be available, we were offered a plastic cup of bottled water. Finally, they did serve dinner which really isn't that appealing at 1.30 am. As a result of the flight delay, we missed our connecting flight to Rome. I don't blame Air France for the flight delay, but it didn't improve my opinion of Air France's Premium Economy service. 
If you intend to fly Premium Economy, forget Air France. Not worth it.","2017-07-08"
"4","getting better...","Finally getting better with seats completely flat... it was starting to be embarrassing!

"1","Poor service and communication!","We travelled to London via France & both planes were delayed by 4 hours each causing a loss of 1-day in our trip. The cabin crew were unfriendly & plane uncomfortable. The available list of movies (leisure) were limited and no cable found for charging phones. This is disappointing for a big name like 'air france'..!!! Highly not recommending this airline.","2017-07-07"
"3","poor ground service","We tried using the kiosk to print our luggage tags and boarding passes.  The tags printed for the bags but not the boarding passes.  The attendant who started helping me use a machine I wasn't having problem with other than not printing Boarding passes said I needed to speak with her collegue.  My spouse thought she motioned to the Sky Priority line.  Another attendant said we needed a card for that line so we switched to the regular line.  Sky Prioirity wasn't moving any way.  The regular line had about 6-8 people in it so didn't seem too bad.  However everyone seemed to have an issue and it took a very long time. A spot would open and then traveler's from the sky priority were flagged over.  Slowest line I have ever been in for check in.  The woman who helped us was training but the other 2 people were very slow also.  We were told gate B24.  An earlier flight was boarding at the gate.  Awhile after it left we noticed the gate now said Frankfurt not Paris.  We checked the departures and found our gate had changed to B28.  About 10 minutes before our departure time we were still waiting to board, and at the time it was annouced that the gate had changed.  The flight crew was polite.  We had only 1 hr 25 minutes to make a connection at CDG and we were not even on the aircraft at departure time and our seats were in the last row.  The crew said they would have connection information for us but as we neared Paris they said the system was broken so they couldn't help with connections.  I was surprised that we were offered a sandwich as well as a drink on the flight. The sandwich was tasty.  The service in the air was fine but based on the ground service I don't know that I would choose Air France again.","2017-07-06"
"3","Food has improved recently","Have flown this airline on a number of occasions in recent years. The airline has been suffering as many others are, but at last they seem to be thinking of their passengers instead of listening to accountants! There are a number of small improvements that they could still make without any cost to the airline, but they have improved the food. It's a big step, but I wonder how much is wasted on these meals. The quality improvement is great but would it be possible to have a pre-selection or choice, especially for breakfast - it could also help the 'personal' approach instead of presenting a tray with everything on it.","2017-07-06"
"2","Cancelled our flight without notifications","When we tried to check in 24 hrs before the flight we were not able to do so. After trying numerous times were told to check in at the airport. Luckily there was an Air France office across the street from our hotel. After the Air France office also was not able to check in they discovered that the flight had been cancelled for  more than a month (with any notification)The only reason that I did not rate this airline terrible was that the agent in there office worked very hard to get us rebooked on another flight. The best that she could so was a flight that took more than twice as long.","2017-07-06"
"2","Late / Poor Communications / Grimy","Flight Info display was incorrect (showed ""Boarding Closed"", wrong gate # until last minute, no announcements, we boarded late, plane did not leave gate for over 20 minutes after new departure time with pilot announcing delay for refueling and baggage issues, (obviously not true).  The old 340 was very dirty, with greasy hand prints on overhead compartment doors and panels.  Every surface needed a good scrubbing.  The video system failed on the entire plane more than once.  The food and flight attendants were very good, the bright spots of a bad experience.","2017-07-06"
"5","Top Notch Airlines!","Recently flew Air France from Toronto to Bucharest.  This airline is top notch!  Staff is extremely friendly, food was very good, flight went very well.  We even had a situation of a very disruptive traveler in our row.  The attendant handled the situation with total professionalism and when the person continued to disrupt the flight, she called the captain who handled it with calmness and ease and settled her down without a huge scene.  i was extremely impressed given all the press lately on airlines.  We have flown Air France a few years ago and it was also a wonderful experience.  I will definitely fly with them again!  KLM was our flight home and they also were wonderful!","2017-07-05"

"5","The upper deck of the A380 is a haven of peace and quiet","I paid extra to get both seats in a row of two (row 93) for myself and my husband on the upper deck of the A380. While some people might object to being so close to the lavatory, it was a plus for us. Also, no one behind us and a good amount of leg room.  Bonus: under the windows there is additional storage space (the guy in the row in front of us tipped us off to this) and so we were able to stow the cheeses we were bringing home from Paris under just the right temperature conditions for the entire flight! Only 30 some-odd rows on the upper deck - it was very peaceful.","2017-07-05"

The food was excellent, choice of wines and a small cognac bottle after the meal.  The hostesses were pleasant and ready to help.","2017-06-28"

"4","Experience the A380","The flight was uneventful.  Service was good.  Hard time in understanding the pilot due to accent but the legroom was also very cramped, but seating good.  As we are tall people and always enquire for the extra leg room as it is just too expensive to book in business class for that legroom. Not always very easy to walk in the plane to keep the circulation going but it was ok.  Food good and personnel very friendly on the plane, but not very helpful in the airport building.","2017-06-28"
"3","Economy flights are just that!","When paying for economy,  it appears one should get used to settling for less as opposed to getting  ""better value"" for one's money.  Even one it comes to getting ready to board,  one almost gets the impression that one has settled for  ""cattle class"".  Seating has become way too ""squashed"" - on long haul flights space is relevant. Food not great and choosing a seat closer to the toilets and/or kitchen areas are noisy - not necessarily from passengers but crew chatting throughout the night - making sleep very difficult.","2017-06-28"

"1","Late departures Lost Luggage Rubbish drink and snack","Check in at BHX was a shambles. Air France and KLM use the same 3 check--in desks. We were queueing half way down the hall. Flying to Ljubljana via Paris CDG airport. Booked with Air France and a choice of 1hr 10 mins for transfer flight. First of all it was 30 mins late departing from BHX, second you have to get from Terminal 2E to 2G. Terminals 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E and 2F are in one building, 2G in a different building 20mins by bus. Just made the connecting flight. Our suitcase didn't. Air France at Ljubljana airport gave us a small bathroom bag with a 2"" toothbrush, a plastic comb and a 'T' shirt that wouldn't fit a 10 year old. Arrived at the hotel at 4pm and told that on Sunday ALL shops close at 3pm. Bought some emergency supplies in a local market. Suitcase turned up 25 hours later. Complained to Air France who just refused to pay anything without receipts. I explained that outdoor markets do not give receipts  and they do not pay any compensation for the inconvenience. So no compensation at all. On the flight back from CDG to BHX my wife was allocated seat 22E and me 24E, and we were second to check in.The so called snack and a drink on the first flight was a croissant and a cup of water. Rubbish spoilt our holiday and will never use them again.","2017-06-28"
"1","Most uncomfortabe flight ever","Ten hours in a seat that doesn't recline is far too long, it was hard and I resorted to sitting on the pillow and blanket.

"5","Flying with Pets?","Our dog trainer had recommended Delta/Air France as pet-friendly airlines.  We wanted a direct flight from Los Angeles (to minimize time in air for  our two dogs) to Paris, and, through Air France, we were able to provide our own documentation and make the arrangements to fly our dogs.  Throughout the entire process, the Air France team was so kind, and so helpful. 
The trainer had also recommended that we take the same flight as the dogs, and that we write letters to the pilot and crew noting that our pets were on board, in cargo, and for them to please make sure that climate controls were in place in the cargo area.
The crew was kind and attentive to our worries, and reassured us that all was well in the cargo area.  They also told us where we needed to go to collect our doggies post flight.  
But even more meaningful to us was the cell phone message we received a day after we landed in France. A flight attendant had taken down our phone number from the outside of the dog crate (where is is affixed for identification purposes) and rang us up to make sure that our dogs Woody and Mac had arrived in France safely, and had been treated well upon the exit.  She explained that she and the other crew members were all pet owners, and that they understood the worry that 'parents' have when their pets are separated from them en route.  It was a lovely message and sealed the deal for us: We shall, whenever possible, fly Air France with or without pets!!","2017-06-27"
"1","Customer Service is non-existant","My daughter was on a limited time visit to Paris and wanted to do a quick jump to Amsterdam.  We had an 8:45 flight so left for Charles De Gaulle airport at 4 am.  Upon arriving to check in we find our flight had been canceled without any notice.  Air France sent no emails letting us know.  When we finally found a service desk we were told that we had been rebooked for a 6 pm flight. I had purposely booked the early flight so we would have almost two full days in Amsterdam.  Now we were down to one.  Try as we might to explain the situation the Air France in GDG were unhelpful and by noon we gave up and headed back to Paris.  Neigher KLM, Delta or Air France would help us. I am still attempting to get a refund and get nothing but a runaround from all involved.","2017-06-27"

"5","Air France Outstanding","I, family members and friends have been traveling this same schedule twice yearly since 2007 and there has not been a single instance that bears complaint. Accommodations from check in to arrival and deplaning has been without fault and the service from all Air France personnel has been ideal. In regard to Charles De Gaulle, this is a very well managed facility especially in light of its tremendous size and unceasing passenger and air traffic. The security is superb and the airport police and immigration staff are deliberate and altogether polite. Navigating about the departure gates and from terminal to terminal is thoroughly organized and decidedly convenient. I look forward to a similar schedule in October 2017.","2017-06-27"
"4","Clean, modern, great service.","Although economy seat are a bit uncomfortable, AF were quite acceptable. On board service was kind and pleasant.

I would recommend purchasing a special meal online before checkin, since they have some good options at decent prices.","2017-06-27"
"4","Good Flight","We fly from the Panhandle of Florida to Hungary every year. When searching flights the choice generally comes down to Delta airlines or United airlines. Delta includes Air France, and KLM. United includes Lufthansa.  We prefer the Delta family of Airlines especially Air France on the long overseas flight. The AF crews just seem to do a better job and their planes seem to be the newest. We have flown both United and Delta to Europe several times and the Delta/Air France are always better.","2017-06-27"
"2","Air France 1120: bad seats in Business Class. Lost luggage","I took flight 1120 from Paris to Tel Aviv last June 22nd, in an Airbus 320. The check in process was slow and the flight was delayed some minute. The business cabin seats are like Economy, but leaving one seat free between the window and aisle. That means, not enough place for your legs, and almost they don't recline. Really not a business class. No wifi. No entertainment system or even music for a flight of 4 hours 10 minutes. It's not worth paying for it. Food service was medium. The luggage of many passengers was ""lost"" or ""left"" in Paris, including mine. No justification, when I made a stop of 6 hours and 50 minutes. The luggage tag of ""priority"" was useless. The process of claiming for the luggage was chaotic. Many passengers trying to claim , no rows, 3 people at the front desk. Poor information. It took a lot of time. I left the airport 2 hours and a half after arriving.","2017-06-27"
"3","Sheeps Cheese and Red Pepper Spread in a Pretzel Bun!","I don't know why full service airlines dumb themselves down to low cost standards. The equipment was an A319 with 3 and 3 configuration. It is a really short flight but really don't bother serving food unless it is generic. Sheeps milk....really. I wish they hadn't bothered. It pushed back 10 minutes late but arrived at Terminal 4 on time. Took an age for the luggage to appear.","2017-06-27"
"5","Wonderful flight!","My husband and I had a wonderful flight experience with Air France on our return flight from Paris. The seats were quite comfy and reclined. We each had our own TV screen when a very nice selection of free in flight moves. The cabin crew provided headphones as well if you didn't have your own. 

We were lucky enough to get in one of the 2 seat rows so it was just us sitting together. The service was great and I believe our flight attendants spoke 5 different languages, so we never worried about not being able to be understood.  

oh all the flights we took in and around Europe I will say this one was the most comfortable and had the best service.","2017-06-27"
"2","Needs to Improve","We selected Air France due to a tour commitment from Paris to the battlefields of WW1 and WW2. This was our first experience with the airline. It will also be our last.
On our outward flight we paid extra to upgrade to Business. The flight and service was adequate but not up to the Business standard of other airlines that we have used.
The return from Paris was simply terrible. The economy seating was very tight and the seats most uncomfortable. The staff seemed unable to cater to the full aircraft. The trip was made even more disappointing due to inconsiderate people in front of us who kept their seat backs at the most extreme limits thereby further limiting the space we had. No amount of words in English or French seemed to be understood by them and they simply ignored us. All this made for a most uncomfortable flight home.
I will not use Air France again.","2017-06-27"
"4","Air France provides service with a smile :!:","the service and food were exception on Air France, even in economy.  Download the app and you can change seats and even upgrade if available at check-in.  The premium economy upgrade was $299.  i tried to get it but they credit card wouldn't work on the app for some reason.  on the Boeing 777 the seats are ten across in economy making the aisles very narrow.  The bulkhead row at 28 is fine if you're not too tall.","2017-06-27"
"5","FANTASTIC CREW!!!","It was an awesome experience flying with AIR FRANCE, from toronto airport to
France, ground (desk) crew are FANTASTIC AND VERY HELPFUL AND ACCOMODATING! food are excellent and stewardess are just perfect! will fly again with AIR FRANCE on our next trip to Europe :)","2017-06-27"
"3","Lousy ground crew","I had a hard connection flight, flying from Toronto to Paris, 3 hour layover and then another flight to Tel-Aviv. When arriving to the check-in stand in Toronto, I was asked to send my 2 year old's stroller as an oversized item. So I had to spend 3 hours in the airport chasing a two year old without a stroller. When the boarding process started, there was no priority given to either handicap people or families with small children. I tried to talk to the station manager but she didn't really want to hear me. At least the flight crew noticed how aggravated I was and upgraded me to an exit seat.
When I arrived to Paris I was shocked to realize that I will only get my stroller in Tel-Aviv so again I had to spend another 3 hours like this.
The aircraft to Tel-Aviv was an A320 with very little leg room, and I felt extremely cramped.","2017-06-27"
"2","A lousy experience in the Affaires cabin","Check-in was horrible- they only had one lane open, which was supposed to be the Sky Priority lane, but everyone was using it. It took roughly an hour for something that is only supposed to take perhaps 5. 
Catering was horrible (I know, I couldn't believe it either) and the service was very uneven- I was on a Sunday afternoon flight from CDG to JFK, and the rest of the cabin was French businesspeople. I was a distinct second class citizen- everything happened for me after the francophones, they even reversed the order that they did things when they got to myself and my seatmate as compared with the rows in front and behind us. It was clear that my business would be tolerated but not appreciated.

Then it took well over an hour for my priority tagged bag to be delivered. They delivered the crews bags in under 20 minutes.

I wasn't expecting the best hard product because I knew the A380 business class seats were on the old side (not lay flat and not all direct aisle access) but it was a daytime flight and I really appreciate how quiet the front cabin on the top deck of the A380 is. 

I was shocked that the catering was so bad, and the checkin, in-air service, and luggage thing seem like punchlines to anti-French jokes!","2017-06-27"
"5","Consistently one of the better airlines","As stated over the years we have taken various airlines and definitely AF is one of the best. Excellent on/flight service, food quality, on time travel.","2017-06-27"
"5","First time in France, first time Air France","This was our trip back to Houston. The airplane was new and the seats were great, even though we were flying in Economy. Personal screens were awesome. Kids meals were served first; they were nutritious and delicious . Adult meals were really good. AF gave us ice-cream mid-flight; wonderful. Flight attendants were really nice and professional. We dropped our luggage a day in advance. The best flight we had had period.","2017-06-27"
"4","The Long Way Around","We flew to Italy last September from California.  We had been once 2 yrs earlier.  The flight was fine and well worth the extra money to get two seats only by the window rather than being in the 3 across or in the middle.  My only recommendation is that this is a very long way to get to Italy.  In total, we spent 22 hrs. First, we flew from Sacramento to LA.  Then we boarded Air France, flew to Paris, our next flight was 2 1/2 hrs late, and finally arrived in Florence.  Our first experience was flying from SFO to JFK to Milan, Italy.  It seemed much shorter.  Florence has a small airport.  Flying back with KLM wasn't much better. The flight was fine, no complaints.  But delays getting out of Florence, flying around a storm, and literally running through the airport in Amsterdam to get our fight.  If we return, we will not fly into Florence.  I would recommend going into a city with a larger airport and taking the train eventually, or car if you have a rental, to reach Florence.  Flying in and out of Florence is just not that easy and really adds hours to your trip. (Only one flight number is allowed in this box, but there was actually a flight from LA to Paris and them Paris to Florence.","2017-06-27"
"2","Missed my connection due to late arrival.","Our flight was over 2 hours late, so I and most of the plane missed our connections.  Air France handled it very poorly...kept telling us to go to a different line for re-booking and then back to the first line...what a mess.  Then on the way home my bags got left in Paris and did not arrive until the next day.  The Premium Economy had good food, but lousy service and comfort (seats are poorly designed and the foot rest comes up only a small way and puts one's back and legs in a really uncomfortable position.  The entertainment was limited and the quality of the personal screen was bad; in this day and age the picture should not be of poor quality. I did enjoy the noise canceling headphones though, best I have used on a plane.","2017-06-27"
"3","Making Business Class Average","AF took the extraordinary A380 and made it ordinary. Stairways are restricted. The upstairs front lounge is empty except for a few non functional screens. The in flight entertainment is balky, and there is nearly no space for small items. Seats have no leg rest for partial recline. Experience is like Amtrak with better wine. Disappointing. ","2017-06-27"
"5","Good flight","Very good flight, free snack and drink was also nice. Was able to check in easily at the airport and baggage was delivered to the belt at the other end very quickly.","2017-06-27"
"3","One shining moment on an average flight","Very average service except that a very nice man offered to let us board before our group was called- guess he had sympathy for two babyboomers. Inflight service was OK... disappointed that the flight attendants don't have nicer uniforms!","2017-06-27"
"1","Horrible customer service","I booked this flight through Delta and didn't realize it was an Air France/ CityJet operated flight.  The automated check-in email I received from Delta led me to believe I should check in with Delta, when I attempted to do this online I realized it was a partner flight. Delta's website said it was CityJet, but CityJet claimed to not fly that route.  I had to call Delta, and wait about 20 minutes on hold to be told to check in with Air France.  Not sure why this information couldn't be included in the email.  Checking in with a lap-infant with a pre-confirmed (paid) ticket was a nightmare.  Although I had already paid the (ridiculous) fee of over $300 for my son to fly without a seat, the Air France agent told me that there was something wrong with his ticket, that she couldn't fix, and that I would need to call Delta myself to fix it.  She pointed to a phone across the airport lobby that I could use to call Delta.  Since I was traveling solo with my luggage, a carseat, and a screaming infant by that time, I decided to pay international calling rates and called Delta myself while standing beside the line.  After over an hour on hold/talking to Delta/Delta talking to the Air France agent/calling back Delta/repeat/repeat, I was told by Delta they had the issue resolved.  And by Air France that they did not have the issue resolved.  Eventually someone figured out the problem, leaving me with about 20 minutes to clear security.  I had arrived at the airport 3 hours early and was the second person in line, and I had to ask for expedited security in order to make my flight on time.  The flight itself was actually great, the flight crew were great, but flying from CDG to JFK, I gate-checked my son's stroller and when we arrived at JFK I was told I would have to collect it at the luggage carousel.  Which meant me, dragging a 30 pound child and all of our luggage through immigration and to baggage claim, without any help or offers of assistance.  I travel solo with my son A LOT and with a stroller, I never have a problem.  Without a stroller it was very difficult.  I had to search JFK for a skycap to assist us, once I found one they were helpful, but very hard to find.","2017-06-26"
"5","On time,steward at boarding and on flight very  helpfull and polite","A safe flight without problem. The fight left on time and arrived 20 minutes ahead. It was a night flight. Il was very quiet and most part of passengers were sleping and so I did. They turned  the light off aroud 23h until they annonced the landing in C. de Gaule at 20 to six. The hostess  informed me were to get the  bus for Paris downtown. Very attentive stewardess. Good normal flyght.","2017-06-26"
"1","Upgrade seat","Very bad company. Has a lot bad things in the air companies. Looses luggage and personal belongings. I couldn't upgrade the seat to higher class. Make sure you don't used it in your life.","2017-06-26"
"5","Good service and good food","Air France have very good service plus the meals are better than most other airlines we have flown with.","2017-06-26"
"3","Decent Food, Tight Seats","Flights were on time.  Food was decent and movie selection was good.  Seats seemed smaller than I remember.  Making a domestic connection through Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris is unpleasant - long lines and only a couple of immigration officials.","2017-06-26"
"1","Very bad behavior ","My assistant book the flight for me and they just inform us in to the ticket 1 pc of baggage !! But they stopped me and talked to me in very bad body language, high level of sound, with out respect !! 
I going to customer service to talk to supervise but he was bad than his college!! After words they charge me 150€ just for 3 kg ...

I tired to explain them I travel a lot with all air lines and their limit was 30 Kg, they sow by themselves my ticket with any limits but they talk to me with very bad behavior and no respect , in my opinion it would be better to fly with Mayan air, Iran air, Qatar, ... than this kind of air lines with out respect ...

Hope it would help you guys !  ","2017-06-26"
"1","Give us your money or go to jail.","When we argued with the manager about what we could pack(*because the disallowed items were not listed on the website as disallowed), he sent my nephew, with an escort, to the police station to discard the items. Instead, he was taken to an empty building and told to give them his money or go to jail. This is only part of the story. We believe that the manager was in on the scheme.

This is the second time in a row that we've had trouble at that check-n counter. (We were told, ""different airport, different rules""')

Once we got on the plane, the crew were very nice.

The airline has not responded to my letter.","2017-06-26"
"4","Not too expensive and went relatively smoothly","The Air France ticket I got definitely beat out the competition for the flight and time that I was travelling. The itinerary was relatively smooth though I took off a star because both on the way there and the way back we experienced delays of about 40 minutes on one of the legs of the journey. The airline did book enough of a layover that this wasn't a major issue and we made all of our flights though it certainly did result in a bit of a sprint through the Bangkok airport and Charles de Gaule airport. I thought the airline food was respectable, though I wish they came by more frequently to offer more water and drinks. Leg room is always an issue for me being 6'4"" and my knees definitely were a little jammed into the back of the seat in front of me. It is important to note that AF charges extra for emergency exit seats if there are even any available when you book. Not sure if that's standard for most airlines. The in flight entertainment was good, and there were personal touch screens on every seat of every flight. Good movie selection, was not bored on my 20ish hours in the air. 

TL;DR great experience for what I paid barring flight delays, consider paying extra for emergency exit if you're tall, in flight entertainment was good.","2017-06-26"
"1","Just a bit of chaos...","Flying from Budapest to Madrid my luggage got lost in Paris airport.  It took 2 days to Air France to find it and deliver it to my hotel. Was a real pleasure in 41 degrees Celsius in Madrid staying in the same dress. On top of all, two days later, returning back I could not check in online.  In the Madrid airport I got the info from the flight personnel, that I did NOT fly from Paris to Madrid, this is why they cancelled my return flight.  Strange situation - that I did not fly, but in the same plane my luggage was lost.  I think there is a bit of chaos at Air France sometimes....","2017-06-26"
"4","Air France MEX-CDG-MEX","Excellent service from the crew, very attentive. Most of them speak french, english, spanish and italian, very handy on a plane full of mexicans.
We flew on the A380, great plane.","2017-06-26"
"5","On time and excellent in connections","I and my wife flew from Rennes to Milan with baggages.
The flight required a change of aircraft in Lyon, with a very thight pause between the two flights (40 minutes).
We were concerned about the availability of our baggages in Milano Malpensa.....but, thanks to Air France, we were wrong: the baggages were there.","2017-06-26"
"4","An interesting flight, which could have been worse","My wife and I booked a return flight from Basel to Newcastle for USD 200 each, which was very good value. The check in service and connection service in Charles De Gaulle was excellent, especially as my wife had assistance because of a sprained ankle. The flight to Chares De Gaulle was delayed so we just made the connection to Newcastle but our bags did not. They were delivered the following morning. The return flight to Charles De Gaulle was also delayed but, as we had checked in early, Air France quickly transferred my wife and me to British Airways flights via Heathrow and we landed in Basel around one later than the Air France flight although, in this instance, we would have had to spend the night in Paris if we had flown the sector with Air France, which would have badly affected our appointments for the following day.","2017-06-26"
"3","Business class in Short haul flights isn't worth the extra money","We flew from LAX to CDG on the A380 - and having the seat open into a bed - was just great.

And then we flew CDG to TLV on A320, which was a waste of money since it was regular economy seats (they just leave the middle seat empty).
Food on the second flight was decent, but again - not worth the extra cash. 

During the layover in CDG we stayed in their  business lounge which was comfortable, but the showers there didn't seem so clean so I avoided it.","2017-06-26"
"5","Premium Economy on this airline makes all the differetnce compared to UAL","We've made this trip five times on United.  Their Economy Plus gives you a few inches and little else.  AF Premium Economy is almost what international business class was not that many years ago.  Seemed like a foot and one-half more room, storage next to the seat on the two seat sides of the plane, easy to access overhead storage, a separate compartment from economy, wide isles, excellent and attentive service. Better electronic accoutrements. Meal service was well presented but nothing to write home about (average airline food).  Nevertheless, a truly better travel experience.

Negatives, only two accessible bathrooms on our level.
Flight 083 to Paris 5/26r, 084 on return to SF on 6/10..","2017-06-26"
"5","I like Air France","AIr France service and inflight entertainment is one of the best. And the beverages and food is also excellent. Air France is my choice when flying to Caribbean islands from Europe","2017-06-26"
"3","Great Wines, Good Comfort Level, On Time","Everything worked.  Good entertainment offers, comfortable seats.  Disappointed by the food, but the wine was quite good.  Certainly a vast improvement on British Airways.","2017-06-26"
"4","Air France Economy Class","Economy Class long haul flying is never pleasant. However Air France A380 JNB - CDG return is definitely better than average. The boarding and exiting of a 380 is time consuming, but handled like AF did was very good. The legroom is better than anything else I've flown and I'm 6'2"". Seat was comfortable and the meal was normal economy fare. The crew were friendly and helpful. In all a better than average Economy Class flight in a great aircraft with very good crew.","2017-06-26"
"4","ORY - JFK is a great connection for me","I fly into and out of Paris regularly.  For my needs, the ORY-JFK flight is the winner.  When I'm in Paris, I'm on the south side, near Port d'Italie; CDG is, in the best traffic situations, 45 minutes minimum.   Those best traffic conditions are early Sunday morning.   In more normal traffic, it can take anywhere from an hour to two plus hours.

Orly is 20 minutes in good traffic and, because we have at least a few choices in route, even a bouchon on the A6 can be avoided.   

Orly is an easy airport to originate or end a flight, much less crazy than CDG.

The offset to the easy Orly is that JFK is one of my less favorite airports in the US.  Coming in on AF, you use Terminal 1; I take Delta to my home airport, so I walk  between T1 & T2; maybe 100 yards.  From T2, I can shuttle to T4 for Delta.  IF I were on any other airline, I'd need to take the air train.","2017-06-26"
"5","Very helpful","The best airline I have ever flown with.
Helpful, good feedback.
Found my luggage and delivered it to my door when it was not their fault.","2017-06-26"
"4","Flight to Barcelona","Connected through Paris with a tight connection. You do have to change terminals and go through customs but you do not have to claim and recheck bags. We made our connections but there was no time to spare. Be prepared to walk swiftly.","2017-06-26"

"4","Excellent touchdown!","The seat was comfortable and the flight was smooth. The cabin crew were very hospitable and friendly. The on-flight service was satisfactory. The most impressive aspect was the touchdown at Hamad Airport, Doha.","2017-06-06"
"5","Great Service","I had four flights on Air France and I have to say the service was some of the best I have ever had on any airline. They booked the return a bit too close for connection in Paris, but I made it with 2 minutes to spare. LOL they were great and said if I missed it though they would have moved me to the next flight. I flew the long haul from LAX to CDG and return on the A380 on the upper deck and I highly recommend. I will probably go back to Europe and always choose this flight.","2017-06-06"
"5","Best service ever","I have never left a review or comment card for an airline but felt compelled to do so in this case.  The attendants on Air France are so outstanding and accommodating.  The offerings and food were also extremely well chosen.","2017-06-06"
"4","South America avoiding Heathrow and BA","Air France and their partners KLM have several daily flights from Manchester and good connections to South America and we prefer it to Heathrow. The change at Charles De Gaulle was easy. We liked he configuation of the seats (unlike the top and tail we experienced on a previous BA flight. Service was good as you would expect but the Business Lounges were not impressive.","2017-06-06"
"4","Good airline ","Seats aren't too bad since I got a middle seat, it was quite comfortable and enough leg room also considering it was quite a full flight. Food served isn't too bad and the staff is quite friendly, wouldn't mind flying airfrance again ","2017-06-05"
"2","Code share using FlyBe which was poor","Never great when you book with AF and the flight is a code share with FlyBe. Generally you get a voucher for a drink and food unless you are using the flight as a connection, which is annoying.

Flight was leaving at 1450 yet at 1440 the incoming flight had not arrived. All the boards in the airport showed as on time. According to FlyBe staff they are not allowed to change this, how ridiculous is that! Then we missed our slot and the weather closed in which meant a further delay. Even though they allow 90 minutes for the 50 minute flight we were still 50 minutes late","2017-06-05"
"1","Delayed bag for 3 days and flight service very poor","Flight schedule changed a few days before with no explanation. Found out it was a crew change and we had a stop. This meant departing 30 minutes earlier and arrive 45 minutes later in CDG

Impacted me as I had transits either side. My bag arrived 3 days after me

The food on board was awful and the service a mix of rude arrogance

The TVs on the old style layout are poor as is the entertainment offering","2017-06-05"
"3","Pretty average business class experience","Maybe my expectations were bit too high, as our outbound flight with Delta in business was very good. The highlight of AF is definitely their new seat which is fully flat and has tons of space for your feet. Very nice! Also the amenities (kit, slippers, etc) were good. Service was typical French, not overly friendly but quite attentive. But what was really bad was the service flow; for a redeye flight around six hours long, the meal service took more than a third of it. If it would have been a great gastronomic experience, I might understand it, but AF had pretty abbreviated one tray service with main course served separately, so they should be able to do the service much faster. Unlike Delta, AF only has three main course choices, two meats and a vegetarian dish. Why no seafood option? Overall, pretty solid flight but definitely not as good as Delta.","2017-06-04"
"1","Avoid airfrance!!!! ","Horrible! Avoid it at all costs! Guy wearing a black long sleeve shirt with ""security"" on it was extremely disrespectful & just straight up rude! Refused to give me his name, asking me if I was the police, otherwise he would not give me his name! Just awful that a company like air France would allow employees to behave like that with paying customers. Seats are tiny, any person over 180pounds will have trouble fitting in the seats! Will definitely choose another air line next time!","2017-06-03"
"2","If you book waaay in advance, sitting together is an important detail Air France.","Extremely disappointed on return flight to the states via Air France.  We booked 6 months in advance and yet once we booked, they stated could not reserve our return seats until departure day, we knew this was a red flag.  Then of course we were not not seated together - three of us assigned middle seats in 3 different rows - stood in 4 separate lines, arriving 5 hours before flight departure to try and unscrew this mess.  Bottom line, we could not change, could not even purchase an upgrade or understand why we were unable to reserve seats when we booked this flight.  Could not get a human to help us.  Very frustrating.  Then today, when we received an email to rate the flight, when we immediately clicked on the link it says ""you are no longer eligible to rate this flight.""  Of course we cannot.  Very frustrating way to end a trip to Paris - on a bad note.  Customer service extremely poor on this one Air France.","2017-06-03"
"4","Prague to Paris","A Czech air code share operated by Air France. On time, efficient, overall pleasent experience and would not hesitate to book air france direct","2017-06-03"
"1","13 hour flight with water once.","The worst flight i have ever been on. We were giving a meal at the beginning of the flight and offered drinks shortly after. Passengers constantly were ringing for service and eventually resulted in going to the flight attended stations to retrieve their own food and beverages, where you just found the flight attendants hanging out and chatting about their own lives. You must provide beverages more than once on a 13 hour flight! The flight attendants were very unpleasant and seemed to have baguettes stuck up their bums. Will avoid flying with them in the future.","2017-06-03"
"5","Outstanding Business Class","I was blown away with the service and arrangement of business class.  The flight attendants were there at every blink and beck and call.  The food was amazing, with larger portions than normal.  I felt very well taken care of and cared for.  I look forward to flying again!","2017-06-03"
"2","Mediocre at best","The flight from Prague to Paris was ok, except for the fact that I had PAY for any drinks or food, which I would only expect from a low cost. The flight from Paris to Montreal was with a 777 which was clearly showing its age. Outdated and PAINFULLY SLOW entertainment system with a limited selection, although the noise cancelling earphones in premium economy were quite nice. For this price however I would expect a much better quality, on a newer fleet, like MOST low cost airlines have. Furthermore, I was UNABLE to check in using the automatic kiosks at Prague airport because my flight was a codeshare with CSA. This was EXTREMELY frustrating because I then had to WAIT IN LINE simply to check in with a person; the job a computer could do in 39 seconds.","2017-06-03"
"5","Excellent airline","We were a well behaved stag do party who really enjoyed the hospitality of Air France. We were treated to a pain au chocolat and a drink. The airline staff loved my attire and treated me to an extra coffee laced with whiskey, which was very kind of them. They were all very friendly and I even got to have a look in the cockpit, which was awesome. Wouldn't hesitate to use Air France in the future. ","2017-06-02"
"3","Premium economy","I was concerned since the reviews about this class reported hard seats, I found the seats no different than other airlines. The seat did not recline, but there was plenty of leg room and storage. The flight attendants professional but did not extend themselves.","2017-06-02"

"3","nice flight after efficient boarding","I flew between Montreal (YUL) to Bordeaux (BOD), with a transit at Paris (CDG). The YUL to CDG flight was on Air Canada, and the CDG to BOD leg on Air France. This is the review of my flight on Air France.

Overall an ok flight. Eventless, and everything was smooth. The gate agents were polite and efficient, and although the lines were rather chaotic, the boarding was quick. The aircraft was an A319, and I sat in Economy class. Being an intra-european flight, there was no entertainment, and the seats were the usual, not too uncomfortable, but not super either. Once in the air, it’s an hour-ish flight, and so things were quick. Had a cup of water, and we were already descending. The flight attendants were also nice, but nothing out of the ordinary. Overall, a very efficient flight, taking me from A to B without any incident. I hesitated between a 3-star or 4-star, but decided to stick with the former, in line with my other airline reviews.","2017-05-09"
"1","Never never again will I step on board an Air France plane","My husband and I booked 2 months in advance to ensure a good seat with extra leg room in economy class. We did NOT get the extra leg room we paid for. The food was awful and the service was not good at all. I felt like i was in a herd of cattle. We arrived worse than tired and very disappointed. In contrast, our flight back on KLM was outstanding! guess which airline I'll take in the future?","2017-05-09"
"3","A nice flight","This was a surprise trip for my girlfriend. I wanted to try and treat her to something special and so I booked our flight from San Francisco in First Class (La Premiere) to Paris CDG. She did not know where we were going and so when we walked up to the counter I was hoping to surprise her by walking up to the First Class counter, however it was closed, so instead we walked up to the regular ticket counter. When we were next in line to check in (drop the bags as I had checked in online), I noticed that the First Class counter was opening up. When we reached the counter, I was expecting the ticket agent to mention to his colleague (who it turns out is the manager of La Premiere) that we were checking in. Air France treats its First Class passengers to an escort to the security line, and then after that, to the lounge and finally to the aircraft. Neither of us are pretentious people, nor snobs, however this would have been nice to receive as it is part of the fare. However he did not do so, but told us where the lounge is located. We got to the Air France lounge, which they share with KLM, and checked in at the desk. Then we went to the back to have a bite to eat. The lounge is dated and stuffy. After that, we then went for a walk in the A concourse and finally came back to the lounge, where again we had to check in as the same person who checked us in before did not recognize us from 20 minutes earlier. For some reason, this time, she seemed to notice that we were First Class passengers and immediately struck a different and more friendly tone with us and said that we were in the wrong lounge (it appears that Air France now shares the Virgin Atlantic lounge for their First Class passengers). I mentioned to her that we had checked in with her nearly an hour before and she did not tell us about this other lounge. So we were apologized to and led back out thru security as the other lounge is before that, and then met by the La Premiere manager who also apologized and said that this is not who Air France is as she took us to the other lounge (which is a much more pleasant lounge). We were finally escorted back thru security and to the flight. The crew was very polite and pleasant. The seats and interior however are very dated, and we are told that they are updating the interiors (the TV's are very small and did not work the best). I would say that the reviews I had read before booking were correct in saying that the food is average at best. The Lamb that I had was dry, as was the Cod that my girlfriend had. I believe that Air France can do better in this area. Otherwise the service was nice and efficient. We were met when we landed and escorted thru customs and immigration, which is a nice touch, and our guide even helped show us where to catch the train into Paris. I think that Air France would be better served offering a car service as part of their fare as some of the other airlines do when traveling internationally. Overall the service was I would say average, given our first encounter, the food quality and interior of the aircraft. I think that for much less money, that flying in their business class would be a very nice experience.","2017-05-08"

"3","Terrible experience","Flight times changed on return leg twice which disrupted whole holiday with hotels and car hire. Finally did 2 week holiday in costa rica but when arriving at the airport to make the journey home were only told after queuing for 1 hour in check in that 4 hour delay with deltA which they knew about the night before yet we were not informed  and as as a consequence we were at the airport at 4am when didn't need  to be there until 9 am and the delay also resulted in missing flight connection in Atlanta and only alternative they could offer was 30 hour trip home which was hell on earth . We also had to sit separate in Atlanta to London flight despite buying 2 seats together before holiday","2017-05-08"
"4","Best first class service all around ","After an 18 day European journey, I elected to fly Le Premiere for my return flight home.  

Upon deplaning from the connecting flight from Florence to CDG, I was immediately greeted by the Le Premiere concierge to pickup me in a ""limo"" and bring me to our next flight.  Even though the rest of my family was on business class, they were proactive and picked up my family as well which was unexpected.  

Essentially they provide a door to door service and unfortunately due to our short layover, I was unable to experience for what people consider the best first class lounge in the world.  I hope to experience it in the future.

Inflight, the captain of the plane personally comes out and introduces himself to you.   The seats are not private suites but instead they are using private curtains.  This may be more preferable because it may give you the sense of more space and less constricted.  

Food - I have had my fair share of best restaurant in the world and the food and wine options on the plane is equal to what is found in the best that life had to offer on land. I had a 5 or 6 course lunch on the plane.  

The service is very attentive and it is very exclusive.   

If you are seeking a first class product, Air France should be on the top of the list. ","2017-05-07"

"5","Good food, great drinks and –surprisingly—good service!","The food and the drinks were always good here, but the service was, well, too French for me. Paris based crews most of the time look down on Americans. This time, to my greatest surprise, service was as  good as they come: even the turbulence we had in the beginning did not spoil my good impression. I observed them bringing a small bed cleverly installed on the wall at bedtime, for a baby nearby, thus preventing the usual baby noise. We left and arrived in time and the plane was a brand new Airbus. Very good.

"1","the worst in the skies","not only the upgrade to business was 600€ for me and 98€ for my sister, staff is clueless, poorly trained, but the worst part is i lost my luggage and thats the second time this happens with AF. welcome to worst, most unorganized, least human airlines ever. had to land in madrid no meds, no pjs, my only bag was lost with more than 5000€ worth of good clothes accessories and personal items and still had to suffer to sleep my first night in madrid. AirFrance you need to wake up and try harder. until then i hold no respect for you!","2017-05-06"
"3","Avoid the 777 at all cost in economy","First off the price is much lower then than all the competitors so they get a plus but I am getting ahead of myself. I did not check the seatmap prior to getting on the aircraft because I knew that I had a window seat so I left it at that. When I walked onto the aircraft, past business then premium economy, thru the curtain then to my horror I saw that the seat's were 10 abreast!!! That is a 17 inch width seat for a 9 hour flight, an Airbus 319 or a 737 has a wider seat on an hour domestic flight. I fly with skyteam so I had got used to flying Delta's 777 with an 18.5 seat width which is only 9 seats abreast. The recline is a joke so needless to say sleep is next to impossible, leaning into the window helped ever so slightly. The staff however was attentive despite the number of people they had and the food was to be expected on a economy flight. I am flying again and this time I made sure that i flew on a330 which gave a little bit more width.","2017-05-06"
"2","Poor Service","My flight was due to take off at 14:10 and at 12:30 i received a message saying cancelled. I was made to wait around for nearly 6 hours before they put me on a terrible flight with Flybe to Amsterdam which then took me to Florence. Where i arrived at 23:00.","2017-05-06"

Curry Chicken was several pieces of chicken with curry and rice nothing more. Seat does not really recline, it slides a few inches. Movies selection are made up of 95% over 6 months old releases.","2017-05-04"
"5","Ground personnel went above and beyond our needs.","LAX-CDG-VCE and return. We were lucky enough to have mileage awards to upgrade to business class. But beyond the comfort of the seats the crew on board made sure that we were comfortable and everything we needed was available. On our return the wheelchair personnel were on strike in Paris. When we walked off the plane there was a member of the AF ground personnel there with a wheelchair to get us to our connection. I am looking forward to my next trip to Europe and will be using Air France when I do. They have service down and make it look so easy. Oh, and the food was really excellent.","2017-05-03"
"1","Not good for long international flights","Will most likely never fly Air France again until they have upgraded all of their planes.  Nothing like a flight from Chicago to Florence with a plane so old that it still has ashtrays!  The seats sucked and there wasn't a place to plug in my phone or wifi.  I get it, first world problems, but when other airlines offer this service you have to be competitive.  Plus, on the way from Florence to Paris (the layover), we got bumped out of our seats because suddenly they needed French speaking people to sit there...not the case on the way there.  We paid extra for those seats and there was no attempt at compensation.","2017-05-03"
"4","Good service","With the exception of having to pay for you 50 lb bag on air France and no meals.. I still think generally they offered a very good service .. the air stewardesses were very pleasant and the seats were comfortable.

The ticket price was competitive and the flight was not that long that you really missed a free meal. The flight was on time and there were no hassle over getting exact weight at check in...

Your check in counter staff were really nice and pleasant as well.

Will definitely book with you in the future.","2017-05-02"
"2","In conformity with the lowest airlines standards","This a business flight ticket and Air France represents for me the shortest route to Europe where I live. On my way to South Africa, I took a different route.
- flight was on a large double decker aircraft
- boarding was easy thanks to my priority access but nothing obsequious
- your passport is fully scanned and staff exceedingly traying to look for information in the pages like if you were a criminal. When I ask can I help you with something in my passport, they hand over the document to me.
- seat allocation was no tempered with last minute changes but the aircraft was full
- on-board crew was totally indifferent and service was completed in a record time. Just after that, the crew disappeared only to reappear the next day in the morning. It is obvious that in these conditions service was not good: no choice for my food (sorry your choice is no longer available) and drinks were served only once. 
- food was tasteless, cold where it should be hot and hot where it should be cold. Crackers and butter were nice.

I flew with BA and LH on the same destination on other occasions however behavior is just the same. Even on SAA.","2017-04-10"

"1","The worst customer service","As mentioned in previous reviews, Air France's ground service is incredibly unprofessional. Customer service is almost nonexistent. My family and I were trying to check in and we were told to go from one zone to another, waiting in long lines, and finally missing our flight despite us being at the airport 2 hours in advance. 

Ticketing office was extremely rude and refused to help book us on another flight saying that we were not early enough to the airport. When asked to speak to the manager, they refused and also would not provide their name. 

It was highly unpleasant experience and the worst ground service we have ever experienced.","2017-04-10"
"5","I made it to where I was going :)","I have no complaints at all.  The seats were very comfortable and roomy.  The customer service on this flight was pretty awesome.  I did not expect a meal on the flight, but I received a meal, snack and drink (about 2.5 hour flight) The plane left promptly and we arrived a little early.  I took several planes this trip and Air-France was in my top 2!","2017-04-10"
"4","Nice flight experience","We flew Air France to and from Paris recently in economy.  We were really very pleased with the flights.  We reserved our seats in advance, paying a small fee for this. They seemed rather roomy, actually, there was a good selection of cinema including quite a few fun French films that never make it to the US, and the flight attendants were cheerful and professional. Biggest surprise was the meals. I usually hate airplane food but these were really quite good (especially the Paris departure) including nice extras like welcome glass of champagne, cheese, yummy fruit tarts, even an ice cream bar snack midday thru the flight. I don't know how much influence Air France has at Charles De Gaulle airport, and I understand that France is rightly so very concerned about airport security these days, but this airport was a mess on the Sunday morning of our departure.  After obtaining our boarding passes and checking our luggage, we spent almost an hour getting thru a 2nd passport check BEFORE getting to the security checkpoint. The 2nd passport check was very poorly organized, there were huge crowds and much cutting in because many people were concerned about missing their flights. You can't really avoid CDG if Paris is your final destination, but otherwise, I would choose a different airport!","2017-04-10"
"1","Avoid Air France at all cost","Avoid this air line at ALL COST.  The smell on the plane was horrible.  The food was horrible.  The bread was like brick.  But the worst part was they lose luggage that is not recoverable on a regular basis.  My husband and I were flying back from Germany to Paris to HOuston.  They required us to check our two carry on luggage.  I did not want to check my carry on because I had my heart medication  in this bag.  They insisted and said it would be at my final stop.  My husbands was but my carry was not.  We reported the lost luggage and was given a claim number to check the progress of the lost bag.  That night we got a call from South Africa which I could not answer.  When I called back in the morning they said they did not have my luggage. Why did they call.  Now I am having to call my Dr. to get my medication refilled.  My heart is pounding from all this stress.  Read all the negative before you decide to book with Air France.","2017-04-10"
"1","Stand by boarding pass although booked a ticket 2 months in advance","I used Air France airlines and flew to Paris for a week from March 30 to April 6 from Montreal. My return ticket info is Air France Flight 342, 6 Apr-Confirmation no. 3IS8A8. I purchased a return ticket in advance on Febr 6 2017. When I arrived to the CDG airport on April 6 three and a half hours prior the flight I was told that there was no seat for me on the flight and that I was on the waiting list. I was surprised since I never had such bad experience traveling with Air France. I asked the AF representative to help since I had to be home in Montreal (I have two kids and had to be at work on April 7), so she told be that most likely there would be no seat and I would stay for one more day in Paris. She recommended me to upgrade my ticket if I want to fly so much. I had no choice and paid additional $241.57.
I really feel stressed after that flight and most likely, I'll have to write bad reviews in all popular ticket flights websites. It just makes no sense to have no seat if you actually book a flight two months in advance. 
Due to the stressful situation I passed in the airport and the additional expenses on the upgrade seat – I assume I deserve a money compensation from Air France.","2017-04-09"
"5","Great service....HUGE airplane to Paris from San Francisco","The plane is HUGE--two decks but so quiet and smooth...even in the mild turbulence we had the plane handled it very well.  The service and staff were great and very helpful.  The food, wine, beverages were delicious.","2017-04-09"
"4","The weakest link in the chain sets the standard","What does it help that the service on your planes is in top when ground service is hopeless unprofessional? On march 10th we were booked on AF 442 which was to leave Paris 23.35. At check in in Copenhagen we were not informed about any irregularities, so I was deeply surprised when I red an SMS once seated in a lounge. It had been sent at 17.29 while we were on our way to the airport = the check in staff should have known about it.
It said that flight number and date had been changed. New departure 11th march 1000 on AF 442A. Apart from an apology no further information. Upon arrival in Paris an Air France employee was waiting at the gate with a signboard. Now we get further information I thought, but no. When we came close we saw that she was to take care of passengers for Johannesburg. We went downstairs in order to find an Air France counter, but found no Air France staff, so we called on the airport Information, who suggested us to go to terminal 2F. After a long search in vain we called on the airport information in this hall. They made some calls and told us to go to the Air France counter in section 2 on the first floor. We did, but there was no staff. Now we started getting desperate. Time was well over 23.00. Finally we found some Air France Employees in another section who was ready to help us. We got a hotel and meal voucher plus boarding card and were told to go to the TGV station from where there was a shuttle bus to the hotel.
It is a pretty long walk, and at a time we came to a gitter blocking the way. Fortunately we are i possession of courage to try side doors and managed to come to the station where we had been told to take the lift to 5th floor (why do Air France not have a folder with information in various languages and a map). Just as we found a lift and pressed five a member of the cleaning staff called us and told us that we should use the lift in the opposite side of the hall. Once at the 5th floor we saw a great information board with the names of a great number of hotels. As I speak french I had no problem reading the voucher we had been given to learn that the name of the hotel was mentioned in the text without being highlighted = it was written with the same typography as the rest of the text, so a passenger not knowing french would have been in great trouble. Knowing the name of the hotel we saw that we were to use the pink line shuttle bus which, of course, left at the same moment. More waiting but finally around midnight we reached the hotel together with a number of other passengers for Rio, who were just as frustrated and dissatisfied as we were as they had had the same problems finding Air France staff to help them. It did not make the mood any better when we learned that the kitchen was closed and we could not get any meal. Under pressure the reception managed to arrange some salad and bread plus something to drink, so at around 0100 we could go to bed. Knowing how long it had taken for the shuttle bus to reach the hotel on empty roads at night we decided to get up again at 05.30 and go to the airport without breakfast. It was a vice decision since we had to stand in line for more that 45 minutes as the passport control where only two - I repeat two - police officers were on duty to serve EU-citizens. OK - it had the advantage that at the following check of hand luggage  there was no kew. Dear Air France, I think it is unfair to the staff on your planes doing an excellent job that your ground service is of that very low and unprofessional standard, and I hope my report will inspire you to give this part of you service a kick in the right direction.","2017-04-09"
"1","Hope you like airport lounges.","Got the Stuttguart -Bordeaux flight only to discover that AF had put my luggage on the next flight.   Waited 2 extra hours in Bordeaux airport.   On the return flight, AF couldn't get the exit walkway to work in Paris.   Missed my AF connection flight.  Had to wait 4 hours for the next one.  30 minutes after we were supposed to have left we're told to disembark.   AF couldn't get their plane off the ground.   Advertised return flight duration: 7 hours.   Actual duration: 14 and counting.   Worst experience with any airline. ","2017-04-09"

"3","Meh...","First time on Air France.  Quite possibly last time if I have other options available.  Flight was delayed (OK, this was due to the plane leaving Paris late due to weather).  However, the ground crew at LAX did not handle the delay well.  The gate was a complete circus - no order, people yelling, I had no idea where to line up.  When I got into the business class line, I was moved into another line.  Finally got to board but stopped at the door and was told ""there is a problem with your seat"".  I had picked a window seat but was changed at the gate to a center aisle seat right next to the bathrooms and food service.  Thanks - so glad I took the time to pick my seat.  Why did I bother?  When we entered the plane, it smelled of fish.  Really, the whole plane smelled awful.  Seat was OK, not great because it did not recline fully (lie flat bed).  Top half is fine, however the foot area is lower so you feel as though you are falling off of the seat.  Food was very average.  The appetizer and salad were fine.  Main course - I took two bites and that was it.  Overcooked, rubbery salmon swimming in a bland sauce.  Sorbet was probably the best thing I ate.  In flight entertainment was not as good as other biz class carriers.  Service was good - the flight attendants were very pleasant and helpful.  I arrived in Paris 45 mins late and made a dash for my connection which I luckily made with a few minutes to spare.  You need to do better Air France - update your planes, update your food and entertainment.","2017-04-08"

I have been flying every month with this airline for the past 3 years and I had only 1 delay that was very well compensated and didn't have to make a fuss about it. Have you ever had issue with British Airways because that's were the customer service stop! 

Also people who are complaint about luggage or else, before reviewing get your facts straight, in 90% of airports around the world, your luggage is not handled by Air France but by a contracted company so don't blame them! (Cobalt for exemple for LHR). 

Thank you Airfrance for your continuous good service and continue like this!!","2017-04-07"
"3","Average flight","Unfortunately our flight was delayed. This can happen. The customer service took good care of us, and informed us via email that the flight would be delayed. We also saw this on our KLM App. 

We were unfortunate to be in a plane, which seemed to feel to me like it was a bit old. The TV facilities were upgraded (which is good) seats seemed quite small, especially when the person infront of you decides to lean back the seat pretty much straight away. 

Staff spoke english aswell, but predominantly french. Sometimes quite frustrating as you need to listen very carefully to understand what the captain and staff are saying on announcements. 

We encountered quite a bit of turbulence on this flight . 3-4 times for long periods. Which meant we could not go out of our seat to make use of the toilet facilities. 

Food was very average, service was barely to be seen. (perhaps because it was a night flight) and the landing wasnt great once we arrived in Paris. 

Think it is important that you get to hear overall experiences.","2017-04-07"
"4","Good staff, service and aircraft","The professional attitude of the crew exceeded expectation. The new cabin design in the B777 aircraft provides a comfortable seat and a pleasant flight experience. The entertainment system is very good. Baggage handling, the lounge and ground support added to the pleasant overall impression.","2017-04-07"
"4","Flying blue partnership","I am a platinum sky miles member and the benefits transfer over to flying blue mostly. My wife who travels with me at times does not get to higher medallion status many times because I am the road warrior. On Delta that is fine, wherever I'm seated is where she sits also. I usually get to sit in delta comfort or first class.  Air France gave me a hard time with this and refused to honor my status because my wife does not qualify. 

Okay I was annoyed, but the staff at the gate were very sweet and seated us in a three seat section just for the two of us. That made it so much better than being squished in the back. I was very thankful for this staff member at the Gate in CDG. The flight and service were excellent. The flight was half empty and most everyone was relaxed. It was great. Delta 8705 or AF 0218.

Food is good service also, they did a good job.","2017-03-09"
"4","Air France shows respect to their customers!","When we tried to board our flight on Sunday morning; we were told the plane had shrunk and were re-scheduled to a next day flight. If this would have been a North American airline (name it) we would have been left on our own pretty much with a vaucher or so. But with European airlines; as long as one flight segment touches Europe you can claim 600Euro per passenger (in addition of them offering hotel and meal vauchers). As a result; this additional night in Paris paid for our whole roundtrip air fair. My advice to you; when you have a chance to book an European airline vs North american (or others); I would strongly suggest a European one. In addition; their meal are typically a higher standard too! I definitely love Air France and AirItalia...","2017-03-08"

"5","Air France Nails It","Air France got it right, at least in Business Class. Wonderful new business class flat beds, in the nice herringbone configuration that most airline companies have these days in Business, securing privacy and easy access to your seat wherever you sit. As a Diamond Medallion Delta card holder, besides Delta, I often fly KLM. Alitalia and Air France. So far Delta had on most flights the flatbeds already, followed by Alitalia and now Air France. KLM's new business class is similar to the Delta business class on continental flights, quite disappointing as it lacks the herringbone aisle access for all seats. The Air France seats are quite similar to the Cathay Pacific ones, they turn into wide flatbeds and have great storage space, even a small locker for your books, phone etc.
Air France worked hard on improving the service on board. I really felt welcome which is more work than just telling someone ""thank you for being a Diamond Medallion holder"" as I hear a hundred times on Delta flights. The flight attendants were hospitable, knowledgeable about the wines they served and checked in on me frequently in between services.
I made a stopover in Paris, very easy as long as you stick to Air France. If you fly Delta to Paris and then change to an Air France flight the stopover is a nightmare. Last time I had to make long walks, an air train and all of a sudden even a bus. Now I easily walked between terminal 2 E and F.
Last but not least, the food. Hard to get me enthusiastic about airline food but this was simply delicious. Elegantly served on nice plates, tasteful small snacks, good main dishes, cheese and a small selection of small deserts and sorbets. I forgot to notice that like Delta they also serve an express menu, so you can quickly eat and sleep right away. So I missed out on some sleep but I didn't mind it too much as I had such a pleasurable dinner.
Air France has some good deals lately in Business, check it out!","2017-03-05"
"4","Air France - Great Service & Updated Business Class","I recently traveled on AF (DL #8672 - I don't recall the AF flight #).  This was a 777.  The business class had the lie flat seats in the herringbone configuration (cocoon).  The seats were comfortable with plenty of space (I'm only 5'8"").  They also have a large screen.  These seats are so much better than the previous business class seats on AF (which they do still have i.e AF #378).  The meal served was excellent.  I fly AF quite frequently and I think they do have really good service overall.
I would just caution everybody to do their homework when booking flights to see if the plane has been updated (see my other review on AF).  I would definitely book another trip on AF in business class if it has the cocoon seats.","2017-03-05"
"4","Overall, Air France has great service, HOWEVER...","Flyers beware.  I'm a big fan of Air France.  I think, in general, they do have great service.  I fly them frequently and I have to say overall they are much better than most airlines in the US (obviously my opinion).  However I just took flight #378 from CDG to DTW.  It was a A340 (configuration 2-4-2 in economy).  This particular plane really needed an update.  The monitors in the backs of the seats were very small and the resolution was terrible.  If you are on the 2 side, the seat closest to the window has a large metal box under it which takes up space under the seat in front of you.  The economy seats also do you have any power source.  Also most of the 2 side (duo) you also have to pay extra for those seats.  The business class seats are not updated to the lie flat, herringbone configuration either.","2017-03-05"

Due to poor weather I missed my connection in CDG, arriving at the closed gate 15 minutes before take off. I completely understand that poor weather is out of airlines' hands, and so went about rebooking my flight. I won't go into detail, but the guy that served me had NO idea what he was doing. He rebooked me onto a flight that night after an hour and a half wait at his desk, and in a flight attendants words that I spoke to later, I had no hope in hell of making the connection that he had booked me on, then they lost my luggage for 4 days, on top of everything else. When I made a claim, after my holiday, They were rude and sarcastic. They have no human view of a problem, they just saw the black and white of airlines and figures and passed the blame onto everyone else in order to delay my complaint in hope I'd give up. I had a luggage label on my case when it arrived, proving my lost suitcase had stayed in their hands, yet they told me to complain to the airline they'd rebooked me with; just a small example of their happiness to not deal with the complaint. 
It is still an ongoing case as all they have offered me is a minimal voucher on a flight I paid over £750 for. I understand they cannot give me compensation due to the weather delay, but on a human level, they caused me so much stress unnecessarily and I actually missed a wedding because even the flight they rebooked me onto was delayed, but they do not understand it on an compassionate level, because their computer tells them I am not entitled to anything. 

I can honestly say this is the worst experience I have ever had in my life with customer service, I had never flown with Air France and spoke to someone two days before my flight. They told me flying with Air France is the biggest mistake I could make, so this is clearly a well known thing. 

Please, do not think that the flights are cheaper and it will be worth it. If the flight had been on time and I'd arrived as intended etc maybe my review would be different, but I didn't and it gave me an opportunity to experience their customer service in an emergency situation. They followed none of the policies on their website...I suggest before you book with them you look at the likelihood of there being a delay or issue with your flight. If there is, you are on your own.","2017-03-05"
"3","Code share flight with Flybe, arrived early but bag missed connection","Code share with Flybe so all economy. Sat in 1b so extra legroom. Seat was comfortable and the flight arrived 15 minutes early

My bag missed the connection as my flight from Bangalore arrived 10 minutes late making my connection only an hour. AF delivered my bag that evening at 6pm (flight landed 10am so no real issue)

Birmingham airport had no-one on the baggage desk so I waited 20 minutes after the bags arrived before someone could be bothered to turn up. I had tried to use the phone on the desk but it just rang out

You have to pay for refreshments because it is a code share","2017-03-05"
"4","Excellent airline and service","Very good service that could be sometime affected when the provider is not air france directly and the flight service is provided by their cheaper airline. If you are flying with Air France, the service is great, otherwise if you are traveling via cheaper Air France provider, then the cost versus services is really bad, and is not a point to travel with them. very expensive for a bad service or attitude.","2017-03-05"
"4","Excellent service","A lot has been done by AF recently and it shows.
Beyond the upgraded cabin with flat bed, the service has really improved and the crew was very nice, polite and professional.
The meal service was very good too although the food itself was average.
To me the wines selection has gone down in quality, but the overall experience driven by the service deserve a special mention.
Well done.","2017-03-04"
"3","Hard to provide excellent service if the airline puts 468 seats in a B77W...","...but it should not be an excuse.. Anyway I understand that profit is first and then comes customer satisfaction just this is not the best way to the future. This was the motto at the low cost carriers like Ryanair but now - as they lead the market - they opened for better services. Well done. 
Back to AF, Im vegan so im asked for vegan meal but i always ask if its really vegan or just vegetarian. France is a land of chees you never know.. :) but the assistant questioned me did i really ordered vegan menu? Of course, but even he/she should provide me the service and not questioning me.. 
Anyway not so bad but plenty of room to improve.","2017-03-04"

AF does not fly to KL anymore. At check in in Paris staff refused to check in our luggages till KL but only to Singapore (Flight AF to SIN, then to KL with Malaysia, still partner to AF as indicated in AF inflight magazine). As a consequence I had to rebook last minute other flight to KL, find hotel in SIN, ... I wrote to AF, and so far I received after 3 weeks a message saying that they will investigate. What a service! The return flight from SIN yesterday (landing today, AF 257) was of very poor quality in terms of service, unfriendly staff on board, poor quality presentation of food and drinks of low quality. During my stay in KL I had to fly quickly back to Paris, last minute. I flew Thai Airways in business (for a price cheaper than eco premium AF), what a difference. I drew the conclusion myself, NEVER AGAIN. NEVER.","2017-02-04"

We have flown others to Europe, but Air France has consistently good service. The aircraft are A380's and they are huge, but give more space. I personally do not understand how they get off the ground. but they are comfortable and more quiet. The little extras that Air France does are helpful.","2017-02-03"
"1","Nightmare.","Air France has absolutely the worst customer service of any company I have ever flown with in my life, and that includes budget airlines. My first trip on Air France they lost my baggage. The first time I had ever had a bag go missing in a lifetime of travel. I had an important dinner that night and the suitcase contained my most expensive clothes, so I was freaking out. I was so happy when my bags arrived on the next plane that I was willing to forgive the incident. But my last trip from Paris to Los Angeles was so horrible that I was literally in tears. I'll spare you the entirety of the ordeal, but when I was checking in at CDG I was treated so badly by the AF staff that I was speechless. It was as if they were intentionally trying to fulfill the stereotype of French people being rude. Is this a joke? One of the women even had the audacity to YELL AT ME when I pointed out that her associate had not communicated appropriately. The nice man who finally checked my bag in (the only decent human being I encountered) said they might be able to check my second bag for free because of the trouble and went to ask his supervisor. I waited for this woman for fifteen minutes. When she finally got around to speaking to me SHE YELLED AT ME AS WELL. I said, are you serious? I waited here for fifteen minutes for someone ELSE to be rude to me!!? I hadn't even asked to have my second bag checked for free, the agent had suggested it. Enough of these people. I finally get through that and get on the plane and start to calm down. One upside was that the two seats next to me were empty so I could lay down. I hadn't been able to sleep on the flight in because it was too cold and their seats are incredibly uncomfortable, so I was jetlagged the entire week I was in Paris. So what happens? The steward WAKES ME UP to ask if my seat belt was fastened. Whaaaaat!? Are you kidding? You don't wake passengers up on an overnight flight unless there is severe turbulence or an emergency. I was, of course, unable to go back to sleep after that. More, their website is essentially non-functional and I have repeatedly had problems making bookings online... it stalls out and loses data, making it difficult or impossible to progress through the system. Amateur hour compared to other airlines. The onboard entertainment system is also awful and half the menus don't work. I was unable to buy food and just got an ""error"" screen. Oh, and no wifi! Also, they didn't link my itinerary to my Flying Blue account as I asked and the online system will not allow me to add the miles manually. I called and the phone rep was unable to help me either. Huh? At this point I honestly don't care because I seriously doubt I will ever fly with them again.","2017-02-03"
"5","It takes courage to fly to Port Harcourt, Nigeria (via Abuja)","One has to give Air France that they have no lack of courage and continue to serve Port Harcourt, Nigeria -voted the worst airport in the world, where the arrivals hall is a poorly airconditioned tent- via Abuja, an airport with a potholed runway. We very much enjoyed the pleasant service in the business clas onboard the Air France A330 from Charles de Gaulle on this itinerary. 

One can hardly blame Air France for not using their newest plane on this route, and hence somewhat outdated business class seats with smallish TV screens. Also one cannot blame Air France for the terrible transfer at Charles de Gaulle where we had to wait 45 minutes in line for a passport check going from terminal 2F to terminal 2E. 

There was no evening meal served on the flight arriving at 19:10 but the stewardesses were so kind as to give as a second meal tray, since we could not expect any more dinner after the long wait in line at bureacratic and corrupt Port Harcourt immigration and transit to our companies residential area. That was very friendly. The cabin staff also spoke excellent English.","2017-02-03"

The whole crew was arrogant (""hautain"" as the french would call it). The majority of the food and drinks (wines) on the menu was not available and the crew just couldn't handle serving passengers who paid a lot for their ticket. Definitely not even worth a third of what we paid for this ticket. The food and drinks were not what you expect. Regular wines, simple dishes. Nothing special at all.","2017-02-02"
"5","Dependable","I fly a fair bit with Air France and have done both Economy and Business Class. Food is always good, much better in Business of course. Flights are usually on time unless there is a strike of traffic controllers or some group or another but for the most part there is not a problem. Flying through CDG can be stressful especially with connections, you usually must go through security once again and there can be line ups. Flight crews are pretty good and very helpful, if the flight is not full they will usually seat you somewhere else with more space, very nice touch. ","2017-02-02"

Food was unappetising and hot food was only tepid.  Altogether a disappointing experience.","2017-01-31"
"2","Premium economy , especially for Air France staff and families .","First time ever on an Air France .I booked premium economy, as my partner not the best of flier. Seats were in  row 8 of premium econ the last row on the way out. .Majority of passengers appeared to be staff of Air France as the crew on flight spent their time chatting and pouring them drinks and feeding them. So much so, that we got served last ,got a half a glass of sparkling wine each as the crew looked after their friends , when i asked for more , I was told that there was only 3 bottles for premium economy passengers .now the big problem !!!! We had to put overcoats on as the temperature was baltic, having asked so many times to heat up the aircraft . someone must have left the front door open. !!!!!
On the way back was not better a little warmer inside but now we are in the back row of premium economy ,row 16 !!! more Air France staff coming back from their holidays in front of us , I guess. Service , what service , crew have got to look after their pals first . food poor , I asked , was it possible to pay money for a beer in the end as the service was so bad and as for the crew , look after paying passengers first .
 Air France get your act together I booked with you ,not with Ryanair .","2017-01-31"
"3","Terrible ground service","There is nothing special to say about the in-flight service, but our ground experience during the transit stop at the Charles de Gaulle airport was awful. 
We arrived to the terminal 2E and our next flight was from the terminal 2D. 
We were denied the admission to the Air France Lounge in the terminal 2E and they told us to go to the terminal 2D. When we came to the terminal 2D, it turned out that there is no Air France Lounge there. We came back, and they told that the Lounge was in the terminal 2C just opposite the terminal 2D. We came to the terminal 2C just to find that there was no Air France Lounge there as well. If you have been to Charles de Gaulle, you know that the distance between terminals 2E and 2D is significant, and having to run with our bags between these terminals for the many times was not what we'd expected as business class passengers.
Finally we were allowed to enter some travesty of business lounge without sound-isolation, without toilets, without business-facilities, without anything.
Finally we found that our second flight was a code-sharing operated by another company, that's why it departed from the terminal without Air France lounge. But we'd bought our tickets from Air France, we'd paid money to Air France, so we asked Air France for the service and Air France was responsible to provide it. And in any case it is not acceptable when the staff lie to clients just to send them away.","2017-01-31"
"2","Pathetic communication regarding delayed luggage","Luggage was delayed by almost 3 days. However that is NOT my complaint.

My complaint with Air France is the way they handled the situation. 

I was given a tracking number as well as a phone number to call to follow up on the progress with the luggage. This number proofed to be a total waste of time. 

As soon as the luggage was handed over by the airline to a courier company to deliver to my hotel, all communication stopped. Many and frequent phone calls to the helpdesk by myself as well as the hotel for an update was answered by ""the luggage was handed over to the delivery company, please wait for them to contact you"". 

Needless to say they never contacted me. 

To make it worse, I begged the operators to give me the details of the company so I can follow up with them myself, but they refused, saying the information is confidential, leaving me to guess when the luggage will arrive when the purpose of the trip is a week ski holiday and it is essential to have ski clothes and the local temperature ranges from -10c to -2c.

How can an airline refuse to supply information to allow a person to follow up on the progress with his luggage and leave him for almost 3 days guessing?

Shame on you Air France never again will I book on your airline","2017-01-31"
"1","Worst CS, Worst Staff, Worst Service, Worst Airline -Avoid at all cost!!!","I never had the best experience with Air France but I had no idea how grossly incompetent and unprofessional Air France is until I had to deal with its staff over the last several months trying to address a problem my husband and I had to suffer as a result of its careless mistake.  

Sept of last year, we flew into Rome from Seoul with a layover in Paris for our honeymoon. As we were traveling across Italy in train to Paris, we had a roundtrip ticket - meaning our flight back to Seoul departing from Paris for our trip back home.

Without a single notification as to flight schedule changes we did not think there would be a problem. Just to be safe, I had copies of the tickets and flight information printed out. 

When we reached the Air France counter at CDG airport, Air France representative flatly told us there’s no reservation under our names. Luckily we were able to show the agent a copy of our electronic tickets issued by Air France confirming our flight reservation. After a long wait without receiving any explanation from the agent, we were finally told that our reservation for a flight out of Paris to Seoul was cancelled since we flew into Rome from Paris after our Seoul to Paris flight assuming that we would fly out of Rome to Seoul.

To this day, we do not understand how Air France could make a mistake as to assuming that we would immediately forgo our right to use our ROUND-TRIP tickets and not fly out of Paris as originally scheduled months in advance just based on the fact that we flew to Rome using our ONE-WAY ticket. More importantly, I have never heard of an incident in which an airline cancels a customer’s flight reservation without confirming with that passenger first.

 Whether it was due to overbooking or glitch in the system, Air France made a serious mistake and as a result my husband and I could not travel back home seated next to each other. Even under a normal circumstance, such situation is not acceptable for a mishap that was caused entirely by your airline’s careless and illogical approach to managing flight reservation. 

Mind you, we were on our return trip home from our honeymoon! To make matters worse, we were going to be separated for a long period of time due to our scheduled business trips taking place shortly after our return to Seoul. Thus, my husband and I were devastated to hear that we will not be traveling together. Although we explained the situation and tried to come up with alternatives such as upgrading to Business class by paying the difference, the Air France agent was just unwilling to assist us in any manner.  Instead of trying to help us or apologizing for the grave mistake made by Air France, the agent spent the time repeating that nothing could be done before she made a threatening comment that we will miss our flight if we do not leave the counter.

We were shocked that Air France staff is not only rude, many of them do not seem to understand the basic principle of customer service.

More shockingly, neither Air France nor its staff once apologized for the ridiculous mistake it made and for insensitive behavior displayed throughout our interaction with Air France. 

And ... the AirFrance agent NEVER ONCE APOLOGIZED!

After much consideration, we reached out to Air France customer service and inform them of our horrible experience with them in hopes that their service would improve and our future trips with them would be better. 

After weeks of no response, Air France finally responded but never once apologizing or explaining why our flight was cancelled. Instead Air France sent us a generic reply ""airline will make reasonable efforts to meet seat allocation requests, it cannot guarantee the allocation of a given seat, even if the reservation is confirmed for said seat. The airline reserves the right to change the seat allocation at any time."" Along with non apologetic response, Air France offered vouchers for our troubles in an offensive amount of 75 Euros. 

We demanded an apology once again and politely declined Air France's offensive offer to save their a*#. We also re-requested for a re-issuance of a Fly Blue membership card we were never sent with. 

After 1 1/2 months of no response, Air France once again issued a generic response ignoring issues at hand and refusing to apologize for its unprofessional behavior.

Despite my husband being a long time Elite Plus member of SkyTeam / Fly Blue, we will not be spending another penny on Air France / KLM flights. 

I would give 0 for likelihood of recommending this airline and 0 for its overall service!

The transfer system for Air France at CDG has you spending ages going from the plane to a terminal by bus, transferring to another terminal by bus and then often transferring back to the same departure area by bus to catch the plane on your onward journey.
It's always stressful, your luggage has a 50:50 chance of making it and you get precious little time to enjoy the facilities between flights.","2017-01-07"

Or

How the French stole Christmas….

It came without boxes, or bottles or baggage…
It came t-shirts or make-up or jeans
But Christ’s gift of Christmas was there to be seen…..

18 Dec 2016….

Laura and I both woke early today in anticipation of the trip.  It was about 4 am. So we lay in bed awake until near 5 am and then got up to make coffee and complete our final packing.  Two days before I had finally succeeded in getting Air France to assign seats and I was able to get us seated as couples, each in a two-seated section of premium economy.  About 9:30 am I checked the Air France website and the assigned seats were gone again.  I called Air France and they told me they were unable to help and said we would have to get seats at check-in.  We decided to leave early and see if we could get the seats sorted out in person. 

On arrival at the IAH Terminal D at noon we were told that our flight had been cancelled and that we’d been bumped to a flight leaving at 5:20 pm. Instead of 4:10 pm.  Because we would miss our connecting flights we were given a new plan:   IAH to Paris - Paris to Rome - Rome to Naples - Naples to Palermo.  The flight would land around 7 pm instead of 4 pm.   This would mean moving Alfie’s Blue Tours (our ride) and getting to Taormina late but I believed we could do it.   It wasn’t until we were sitting at the gate trying to decide how to rearrange things that we realized that in addition to changing our flights Air France had added a 3rd. day of travel to the trip and not told us.  

Our original plan had been:

18 Dec – leave IAH
19 Dec – Land in Palermo 4:10 pm.  Alfie to transport to Hilton Giardini Naxos by 8 pm.
20 Dec - Tour Greek Theater with Viator Travel on Segway tour.  

And now we were:

18 Dec – Leave IAH. 
19 Dec – Arrive Rome 4:20 pm for layover.
20 Dec – Arrive Palermo 6:30 pm.

I realized that the mess was much greater than I had originally thought.  At this rate we wouldn’t land in Palermo until our Taormina tour was already over.  

I called the Hilton and cancelled our two nights at Giardini Naxos.  I called Alfie and arranged for him to pick us up on the 20th. Instead of the 19th. and to take us to Agrigento rather than to Taormina.  I called the Sogni d’oro, where we’d arranged to stay in Agrigento, to see if we could arrive a day early but Giuseppe said the hotel was booked solid that day. He said he could put us up in his other hotel, La Antica Via, which was also in Agrigento.  So, before we left the airport on the 19th.   We had a major rearrangement of plans and lost the money we’d paid for the Hilton, the segway tour, and the transportation but we did at least board with a plan and a place to stay once we arrived!

We boarded the plane on time thinking we had things settled again.  Air France had scattered us among the seats but Alex was able to switch a seat and at least we were all together on row 19.  This row allows extra leg room because of the bulkhead behind first class.  The seats were good and there was much more room than in the economy seats

19 Dec 16

We landed in Paris around 9:10 am.  The new schedule had us here all day until a 2:30 flight to Rome.  We reached our gate, got some coffee and settled in for a long wait.  All around were people sleeping or trying to sleep in the airport chairs but sleep seemed to elude us.  By the time our flight finally arrived we were pretty beat and we were actually looking forward to the layover in Rome.  As we were boarding the teller had trouble with our boarding passes and had to print us each a new pass.  She said this new pass would be the pass for this flight and also for our next one.

Once we were on the plane I took the boarding pass out to read it and found that we were now booked for a flight from Parris to Rome and then booked for an immediate 6:50 pm flight to Palermo with no layover in Rome.  They had switched our flights again while we were in the air and again without telling us anything about it.

We arrived in Rome very tired and I explained the problem to the Air France representative.  They had switched us back to a late flight to Palermo without telling us and now we had no driver or hotel in Palermo.  The representatives tried to help but our former tickets to Naples and Palermo for the next day had already been released. In the end, we agreed to take the seats and steeled ourselves for a continue journey.

While we waited I again called Alfie and told him the new problems. I asked if he would recommend a good place to stay in Palermo and if he could arrange a driver for us on short notice.  Alfie said that he would come to Palermo right then even though it was a one and a half hour drive for him.  Rather than ask him to take us all the way to Agrigento I asked if he could bring us to his town of Cianciana.  He said he knew of a guest house and we could stay for 2 days and then go on to Agrigento as planned.   Again, we had lost the money for the reservations I had just made in Rome, but we were at least not homeless in Europe!

Deadly tired, but now with a plan, we settled in to wait for our next flights.  The flight was scheduled for 7:20 pm but didn’t board until nearly 8 pm.  Once boarded we waited for over an hour on the runway while they loaded luggage on the plane; we didn’t actually leave for Palermo until after 10:00 pm.   

Following other passengers to the baggage area we waited with them for our baggage.   When everyone else was gone we were still waiting.  By the time we had completed the forms for our 7 lost bags and left the airport it was after midnight.   We finally went to sleep in Cianciana Italy at 2 am on the morning of 20 Dec 16, nearly 48 hours after we had risen to begin this journey.  

Looking back I suppose the critical feature here is Christmas and Sicily. Sicilians enjoy going home for Christmas and the flights were entirely booked and overbooked.  We did get one piece of luggage a day later and we receive four more of the pieces after a week.  Two pieces have never been found.  In spite of this, I do believe that Air France was genuinely trying to help.  They found an option that pushed us closer to our original plan and they gave us that flight.   

It was a whirlwind of confusion at the time but, in the obscuring mist of memory, we can smile about the night the French stole Christmas……","2017-01-07"

"1","What happens when things go wrong?","You really get to know a company when things go wrong. Air France lost my case on the way to Cuba. It contained all my holiday necessities of course and also vital daily medicine. It has never been found. Here is the really interesting part; Air France has never contacted me, at any point, except in the form of automated replies to my submissions. I have spent literally hours on the phone, on the website, preparing extensive documentation that they demand and submitting that online, without receiving so much as a courtesy email to inform me of the status of the lost case. The address for the Air France office in Havana proved to be four years out of date, but I had already wasted half a day of my holiday trying to locate that one. I spent 3 hours waiting for the Air France kiosk to open in Havana airport, only to be told that in fact there was an Air France office deep inside the building. That proved to be completely fruitless, no-one knew anything or cared to help me. When I have telephoned Air France I have spent long periods of time in the jungle of automated operators, only to be cut off each time. Eventually I found a different telephone number that leads to actual human beings, but they proved to be very ill-informed. They could not see what documents had been uploaded onto the website as part of my case and therefore were not in a position to discuss the matter in any useful way. Woe betide the Air France traveller who hopes for customer services. It does not exist. Additionally - the in-flight entertainment screen did not work on either journey. The overhead lights did not work. The flights were all delayed. The seat on the return journey was so uncomfortable it gave me back-ache.","2017-01-07"
"3","Just Average","I am getting more and more disappointed with the Air France flights. It was a A380 and you could think as it is fairly new that it will be comfortable and pleasant, however the seats are very uncomfortable, it seems the legs room are being reduce every year. The meal was a total disaster which I could barely eat and I am not even gonna start with the breakfast that are even better at 7/11. 

The crew was smiling and doing their job properly but not trying to please otherwise, minimum service assured. However they are pretty fast to response to your request. 

The inflight entertainment selection was good enough to make the flight bareable. 

To me it seems that the trend of Air France isn't too match competition flights quality improvement but at the opposite by taking a ""low cost"" direction however only the services, the price it, keep increasing.","2017-01-07"
"1","horrible costumer service and bad stuff training","Not only they have lost my baggage both ways but they have screamed on me and etc, they left e hanging even though I was underage. Even though they knew my baggage didnt make it to the flight it took them 4 days to deliver and plus they will not call me on my cell phone because ts an international phone and not a canadian phone. when contacted on instagram they told me to go to FB when contacted on FB theytold me to go to instagram. On instagram and FB after spamming they told me to contact them on Twitter. Many people did not get their ticket refunded. The stuff cant speak english and the airplaine was really old .","2017-01-06"
"3","Return from Chile","This is my second review of Air France, and it is better than the first.  This was our return journey from our holiday in Chile.  The plane was clearly much newer, and the seating was far more comfortable.  I criticised them previously because of poor food and poor selection of films.  Although the food was slightly better, the film choice was far superior on the return flight, and made it far more bearable.  I have great trouble sleeping on planes because of the noise levels, so like to be entertained.","2017-01-06"
"3","Special holiday to Chile","We were booked from Birmingham to Charles de Gaulle, and then on to Santiago, Chile.  We were surprised at the very short time giving notice of the gate number from which you were leaving, especially as they say they close the gates 40 minutes before take off.  The food was poor, the seating was poor, the staff were helpful and friendly, but we were not impressed.  We were also surprised to see that dogs were allowed on the aircraft in the main cabin, especially as it was a flight in excess of 14 hours 30 mins to Santiago.  Although the dog concerned was not a problem, I have never come across this before.  The film choice on this flight was certainly not very entertaining, there were a lot about war, mainly French films, which I suppose I should have expected, but they were quite dreary.  I prefer something light and entertaining.  I noticed many passengers resorted to watching childrens movies and cartoons for some light relief.","2017-01-06"
"1","Horrible Airline!!!","I have flown Air France twice since having children and I have to say that twice it was the worst experience I have had flying with children and infants. The last experience happened on 01.01.2017, flying with my husband and two children aged 5 years and the other one 5 months.

 When we checked in online from Johannesburg to Paris, the booking system did not allow for us to select seats as we were traveling with an infant. When we arrived in Johannesburg the flight was full, but the lady managed to move things around and we could get seats with a bassinet. 

Upon our return the nightmare started......... We again could not select seats when we left Amsterdam to Paris due to the infant issue (this is on 01.01.2017, Paris to Cape Town). Arriving in Paris we approached the help desk where the ladies were pre-occupied and we had to work to get their attention. When asking if we could get a seat with a bassinet for our 5 month old son we were abruptly informed that the flight was fully booked. My husband then asked why the system is as such that we cannot select seats, the agent working at the desk told us that it is our responsibility to arrange these things and that we should have called the help desk to arrange it. She told us that the flight was full of babies and asked whether he expects her to move another family to accommodate ours. 

We boarded the plane and to our utmost surprise the flight was fully booked and there was a lot of families with small babies but; most of them were crammed into rows just like us!!!! There was adults sitting in the areas which other airlines reserve for babies!! These seats were apparently bought by passengers who wanted extra leg space..... unbelievable that there is such a policy and even worse that the agent in Paris was rude and lied to us!!!! 

We then heard that the flight was delayed due to luggage issues, And then off course the wings needed to be defrosted as it snowed recently. All in all it resulted in a two hour delay in our cramped spot. Our plane should have arrived at 22.30 in Cape Town which means dinner is served at around 20.00, thus we made no provisions for extra food for our 5 year old son. By 20.00 he was hungry, so my husband asked one of the cabin crew if he could have a sandwich for our son, to which she replied that she had run out of sandwiches, he then asked if she could perhaps serve him his meal as he is hungry. She responded by saying that he has to wait until the dinner is served for the flight, and that will be another 1.45 hours!!! He is 5 years old!!! Our son fell asleep hungry, which is unacceptable for me as a parent.

I will never fly Air France again, the service is bad, the staff lies to your face without batting an eye and they are overall unfriendly and rude.","2017-01-06"
"2","Baggage Claim Issues","Very bad experience traveling with Air France and my baggage. There was a very short connection in Paris and AF made no effort to get my bags onto my flight. Instead, I was told (once I arrived in DC) that my bags would come to me the next day at 8:00 pm. Not only were my bags not on my flight, but now I am told I will receive them piecemeal! Two bags tomorrow and one bag in a couple days. Very disappointing and their tracking system shows nothing online. I had to go to the Delta website to track my bags becase they are associated with AF. I was able to locate the two bags that will be arriving tomorrow on the Delta website but it was two different bags than what the representative at AF told me. It will be a total surprise which bags actually arrive and when, because all the information I´m receiving is very disorganized and unreliable. I hope AF deems this worthy of some sort of compensation, because this is very inconvenient and unacceptable from a noteworthy airline.","2017-01-05"
"3","Business Class Merits Frozen / Cold Meals and Lost Luggage","In Sept., 2016 flew Air France Business Class expecting superb service.  Received great look steak - COLD and on another dinner was frozen Camembert cheese.  Carry-on luggage on the flight from Paris to Genoa, Italy was left at the foot of the steps on to the plane but didn't make it to the carousel in Genoa for the hour after the flight; yet another hour later it showed up and we were told we'd left the luggage and therefore had to come retrieve it ourselves.  Care of spouse on wheelchair in Paris as we moved from one terminal to another was SLOW, so much so that we almost missed out connection.  Replies from Delta Customer service included reimbursing us our taxi fees to retrieve our luggage, followed by words that our concerns would be passed to higher ups.  Wonderful  and basically an attempt to mollify us and send us away.  Would I fly Air France again?  Not if possible to avoid them.","2017-01-05"
"4","Air France Airbus A380 Economy Class Duo Seats","Returned to South Africa In pre-booked duo seats.  This gives one a little more room than normal economy seats as you only have one seat next to you and he seat on the window's side has extra space to the fuselage.   There are only a few of these seats available and it dies come at an extra cost.  It is thus essential to pre-book these seats.   

Legroom end recline of the seats are the same as normal economy seats but if you need some extra personal space, it is worth it to pay the extra Euros for that comfort.

Remember - As these seats are at the back of the top cabin, you will be served last.","2017-01-05"
"4","Airbus A380 experience","Booked with Air France direct as it was a direct overnight flight to Paris.  After check-in we killed time in the Slow Lounge at ORT.  The business class on AF's Airbus A389 is on the top deck and our seats were next to the window.  What space !!  Legroom was in abundance and the seats wide and comfortable.  The best however must be the seat that reclines almost 180 degrees and with your foot space, turns into an extra-length bed.  The meals served in this class were exquisite and ample entertainment could be found through the 15 inch touch-screen monitor.

The left side bathroom in the front is really spacious and one can refresh in there without hurting yourself in the process against the walls or equipment.  Drinks and snacks were available throughout the flight but I found the bed the best perk and slept like a baby.

The flight attendants were efficient, friendly and multi-lingual.  The captain handled that big bird with a delicate touch and it was the softest ride I ever had on a plane.

I would like to congratulate Air France with the service they provide between South Africa and Paris - it takes just only 10½ hours to touch down at CDG airport.  

Will I make use of them again?  Without blinking an eye.","2017-01-05"
"4","Good commuter flight but Agen and Orly airports - oh dear! ","This reasonably priced commuter flight takes one from the SW city of Agen to Orly Paris. 

Agen airport is little more than a hut and really a bit of a joke! The flight on Hop! by Air France was on time and in an ATR propeller aircraft. Refreshments are free and plentiful, which is impressive these days. The purser was absolutely charming. 

We landed on time at Orly but then there was no 'parking' space available and we then had to take a coach to the decaying terminal. Luggage arrived quickly, however the hoards of taxi touts at Orly are a pest. 

I would recommend this flight if you're in Agen and specifically want to get to Orly. However, given that the journey from Orly to Charles de Gaulle is a pain if you want to get from SW France to Charles de Gaulle for connections my advice would be to use the Toulouse - CDG shuttle, which is about the same price. 

","2017-01-05"
"3","I thought it would be better","From Luanda to Lisbon via Charles de Gaulle in premium economy. The seat is great for a day flight but aweful for night flights if you want to sleep.
Service is great, food is nice.
When arriving in Lisbon, despite my luggage was tagged with priority, my bags were the last ones to arrive to the baggage carousel at the destination point. 

In the returning flight there were a major delay in all flights due to fog. Luggage drop-off was a chaos. Even with 2h delay in departure, I took the following flight and also my luggage.

I wish those seats could be better.","2017-01-05"
"1","Worst Flight Ever","The service on this flight for 11 hrs was horrendous.  We were flying to get married in Mauritius and changed flights at CDG from Manchester.  The food was terrible and the only drinks offered were an inch of coke out of a ltr bottle, half a cup of coffee with the two terrible meals and a tiny bottle of water.  No other drinks were offered.  My TV was broken and the arm rest on our £100 extra dual seats and the flight attendant just laughed.  I will never travel with Air France again, absolutely disgusting to say we paid £7k for this experience.","2017-01-05"
"4","Huge plane!... great flight Paris-Cancun","I've never traveled on a plane this big!... It was the Boeing 777-300ER and it was huge!... it felt it never ended!...

Seat was confortable, the interactive tv system was amazing... many movies, music and games... and a USB plug.  

Food was normal but good, It was a long flight and they had a self serve bar on the back with sandwiches and drinks...

There was a 1 hour delay and people where just sitting in the floor saving their place in line... I found that absurd... you have a reserved seat, there was no need to be waiting on the floor... You have many stores and snack bars you can be instead of just sitting on the floor...","2017-01-04"
"3","Not able to control connecting flights","I was coming back from Seattle,  USA,  with connecting in Charles de Gaulle,  Paris.  Though it was alliance flight, in Paris nobody met me to take to another terminal. Moreover,  the French dicided to unpack my duty free alcohol and repack again.
As a result, I was running all the way to the terminal to see the closed gate. I asked the lady to let me in. We had about 20 minutes. She refused. I couldn't understand why there was no announcement in the CDG. Why nobody was looking for me. After my quiary she called a  clerk add suggested another flight to Moscow about 3 hours late.
My taxi was ruined, pkans were spoiled.
I addressed AIRFRANCE, made a complaint. Nothing special. They promised to be careful to the passengers. If it was Air I don't know what,  I could understand. But not Airfrance.","2017-01-04"
"1","Potential Baggage Scam","We completed our e ticket confirmation. We had to pay extra for checked baggage. It said if we purchased at time of confirmation we would pay €30 but at the airport €60. We attempted to pay with both a visa and mastercard. Both didn't work and the message that came up said ""invalid number"" (the cards have been working this whole trip)and after the two attempts it wouldn't let us try again. When at baggage we explained what happened. We were told that they couldn't do the cheaper price at the airport and we had to call customer service. We did and the woman said we shouldn't have chosen baggage and said we had to press one in the options menu. She wouldnt transfer us and hung up. We tried again even though option one was actually about being a member of the airline or something similar. After 10 mins we were still on hold. We ended up paying the €60 as our flights were non refundable so we had no choice but to pay. It is my opinion that this is probably a common thing to force people to pay the €60.","2017-01-04"
"1","very bad service on air and at the airports, bags were delayed and received them 2 hours the day i was leaving.","I was charged for a carry on that was not overweight by the company Air France and the Hardship that I didn't have any of my bags when i arrived to my destination. i was staying at my destination for 3 days exactly i received my bags 2 hours the night i was leaving back home. I was going for my father's funeral. i had to buy all my necessities, clothing that i was supposed to have to go to the funeral with. it was such a hardship that I will never forget. When I filed the complaint on the Air France website, I received an email to please send me all the receipts and hardship you had and we will process the complaint. It took my the whole month of December 2016 to talk to the person that was on my case. i called everyday left messages, emails. the lady that is assigned to my case has a very bad attitude. she doesn't know how to do her work due to her messages is over booked on her machine for two weeks. She opens someone's else's file and tells me that its under my name. SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN THAT. REALLY ITS SO TRANSPARENT THAT SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO OPEN FILES. oh and tells me that she knows how to do her job and i should not tell her how to do her job. Also, her email doesn't work and why did you sent the files on this email...hmmm because you told me to send it to this email. Then she says ok lets try to fax the information. I did to the 2 fax numbers she gave me. to my surprise, she didn't receive it correctly and telling me that who i see only one receipt page and its in ""chicken hand writing"" ok but ii have proof from the fax machine that you have reciebd 18 pages. so where does the problem lay...you probably didn't see where are the all pages are because you are so LAZY and don't want to see where are the files. And when i wanted to make sure she received the other pages, she tells me please don't tell me how to do my job....well I'm not I'm asking if you found the other pages. and tells me mamam i don't appreciate your tone please you need to hang up and call me later. I'm asking a very simple question do you have the other pages or do you need me to send it again??? I had a tone through my voice because you are not understanding me and you just want to hang up so that you can just get me off your back. well lady your not going to get ride of me this easy. and to top it off she hangs up on me and puts me on hold with music. And dot on the street can do your job better than you. Her name is SALANDRA COCRON HER PHONE NUMBER IS 1800-619-9615 EXTENSION 5020005 AIR FRANCE IDS THE MOST WORST AIRLINES EVER KNOWN.

"3","A number of strong points but also some drawbacks...","This airline offers relatively decent food, by airplane standards, and more generally the service is alright, though staff is not always equally friendly. One major drawback are the very high prices charged for a number of destinations, where Air France just prices itself out of the market. 
The flight between Paris and Vienna is fine.","2016-12-08"

"5","This is an airline","I flew Air France from JFK to Florence and back with a layover in Paris each way. I can not say enough about Air France. I have flown several airlines in my life, but this is by far my favorite. The staff is helpful, accommodating and extremely pleasant. For airplane food, the food is VERY good. The wine was delicious and they did not cheap out on portions. pillows, blankets, and sleep masks were given. The selection of movies, music and TV are also top notch. Although I must admit I tend to fly with whatever airline is the cheapest, I always keep an eye on Air France prices, just because I know my flying experience with them will be top notch.","2016-12-06"
"3","Unable to pre select your non reclining seats","This leg was the ""partner"" version of a Delta Airlines trip from Newark, New Jersey (EWR) to Rome (FCO).  The Delta portion (flight 20) was very good, although they could take a lesson from Jet Blue and have slightly more legroom on international flights.  Check-in, boarding and the flight crew were all exceptional (and even TSA earns brownie points for very fast security lines).

But Delta's partner, Air France, leaves a lot to be desired.  The main problem is that they do not allow you to pre select your seats.  You must do this at the airport after you arrive (deplane, pass through immigration and make you way to your boarding gate.  With a 2-hour layover that meant I was at the gate 1-hour before departure, and had to settle for what they had left.  Even though I have a disabled person's photo ID card issued by the Government, even the supervisor was ""unable"" to have my travel companion sit next to me.  We had to be separated (which thankfully it was technically a short flight after the overnight trek from the United States).  I must commend the Air France gate staff and flight crew for their doing everything they possibly could to ensure a very nice flight.  But Air France needs to be brought into accords with Delta as a partner and allow travelers to pre select their seats (even for the return flights Delta allowed me to choose my seats immediately after booking the flights while Air France has their unacceptable policy of seat assignments at check-in (before boarding their portion of the flight regardless of your origination).

Just one more item - not a single seat reclined - no they were not broken - it was just Air France.

I gave the overall rating as average because of the exceptional gate and flight crew, otherwise it would have been poor to terrible.","2016-12-05"
"2","Worst food I have ever encountered","Flew from Gatwick to New York via Charles de Gaule (Paris) food was some of the worst we have ever encountered, and half of the inflight entertainment screens were broken. Shan't use again - always pays to fly direct!","2016-12-05"
"1","Truly awful","From check in through to arrival, two (out and return) of the worst flying experiences I've  had.
Check in at Orly is a farce. Staff are rude to everyone but particularly so to anyone who is not French. Boarding was chaos with staff making no attempt to assist. 
Service on board is shocking. Staff are rude and arrogant. Aircraft is visibly dirty. I wanted to shower as soon as I got off. No excuse for filthy aircraft. If they don't clean it how can I have any confidence they maintain it? In flight entertainment failed. Staff made no attempt to fix.
Everything about AF is shabby and worn out. The aircraft, the staff and the facilities.  Rude and arrogant.  Unhelpful. Shocking. First time with them and for sure the last. Air Caribe or Corsair next time. Can't  possibly be worse.

Two years ago my briefcase did not arrived, took them 6 months to compensate, and couple of days ago they charged me 35 Euro for 14.4 kg briefcase. All together it is a very bad choice.","2016-12-04"
"2","Air France - where o where have my bags gone ...?","Mediocre service for the price, meals are average and if you want your bags when you get to your destination do not check them. They have missed connections with my bags every time I've flown them with 2+ hours to make the transfer.","2016-12-04"
"3","A sprint across CDG to get the connection!","Booked a flight from Athens via Paris to Manchester which occurred yesterday. Check in was straight forward and done on line. Athens security check is just before the gates so make sure you have done your shopping and eaten as there are no outlets after security. There should have been an 1h 15 stopover but the Athens leg was delayed and we were sat right at the back so it took ages to leave the plane. Our next gate was miles away so we had to sprint across the airport. Not a good sight. Not a great experience really.","2016-12-03"

Even if flying on Airbus 380 (from Paris to Mexico City), interiors look the same of an old Tupolev: really incredible! It's evident that Air France don't spend money in ordering to Airbus good and spacious interiors ! They care only money paid by passengers.
Entertainment system is one of the poorest among major Airlines. 
I'll try to avoid a such poor airline !","2016-12-01"
"2","Disgraceful","Most local buses offer a better seat than AF business class in its A320 aircraft from TLV to Paris (for a 5 hours flight..!). Service in all four flights was totally French (i.e sour and not pleasant). I wish I could say that about the miserable food. Entertainment was very limited too. Felt like I was back in the 1990s","2016-12-01"
"3","Good if you are aware about what to choose","If you are intend to fly to Havana think that from Paris to Havana there are 10 hours of fly (and 9 hours at the return). To have places at the economic class is not a good idea because the space in between your legs and the chairs from the front of you is to small and for a 10 hours flight can be very difficult to feel good. So, I recommend Economic plus class where you may have enough space to feel comfortable. The food become fair on this flight... When you start from Paris there is a lunch and than one hour before to arrive in Havana they have something more, like a dinner but very light. But when you come back, considered a night flight they give you a dinner and one hour before to arrive in Paris a kind of breakfast almost with nothing. Thinking that just 2 years before was better I understand that step by step this huge companies reduce everything. In the flight from Bucharest to Paris we may choose to drink just still water and orange juice... nothing else...","2016-11-30"

After the meal crew disappeared didn't see them again until breakfast was served, then to finish off they boarded us on the plane only to tell us immediately that we were to be delayed for 2HOURS due to fog in London, why on earth did they board us we sat on the tarmac at the gate the whole time, disgraceful, have nothing good to say about this airline","2016-11-04"
"2","Appalling Customer Service","My wife and i recently travelled Singapore / Dublin return with Air France. 
On our return I received and email asking me to do a survey on our experience with Air France, My notes on that survey are reproduced below.

The wheelchair assist for my wife was shocking at CDG. We were taken off the plane and left in a ground level seating area and told there would be a wheel chair provided. No wheelchair came. We made our way to the lounge and when we raised the issue with the staff they just said that it was not their fault as they were not responsible for the wheelchair service.
The staff said they had ordered another wheelchair to take my wife to the departure lounge. It was due a 8pm for the 9pm flight. At around 8.40pm we left the lounge, on foot, as no wheelchair turned up. At this stage my wife was in tears and very stressed out.
In addition to this incidence, on our  flight between Paris and Dublin, one of our bags got lost and it was over 48 hours before it was returned to us. It had been our intention to fly out of Edinburgh, back to Paris, but the delay with the bag meant it would have been too rushed for my wife and we decided to stay in Ireland and fly back to Paris from Dublin. I booked return flights from Dublin but, despite all my efforts, I was unable to get any assistance from Air France, to cancel the Edinburgh to Paris booking. I had, on 3 separate occasions, tried to do this but as yet I have had no response from Air France. I am seeking a full refund of those airfares and also given the shabby treatment we received in the Air France Lounge I would like a refund on the payment that we made to use the lounge. (Note: I have sent a further 2 emails to Air France since our return home and as yet I have had no reply from Air France apart from the automated reply - see below)

On the up side, I can only praise the ground staff at Dublin. They were most obliging and courteous when we landed and had to chase a lost bag and the Lady that checked us in the afternoon of the 5th Oct in Dublin as we had a couple of unlinked bookings and she was so helpful in managing to get bags tagged all the way through to Perth.

In all, the experience with Air France was mixed, but in regard to further flights with them I must say that I am very reluctant, as the problems that we have had, seem to revolve around CDG and since that is the Airline's hub I don't look forward to using that airport again.","2016-11-03"
"4","Excellent attention and good flight","we travelled in connection flights from DXB to Paris and from there to Miami. Its totally nice flight and great food served with care. Overall less price compared to other airlines","2016-11-03"
"3","Disappointed","We have flown with air france a number of times to make this same journey and never had any thing to complain about. Staff friendly and polite, nice airbus plane and always on time oh and free snack/drink. Fast forward to now, i have gone on their website to check flight price etc for the same trip next october. 2 ad 2 children (9 yr old) £589 previously one piece of hold luggage was included per person in the price, seems like they have changed this and it is now a paid extra adding an extra £40 pp per flight. So basically we would be paying a high price for the same system/service offered by budget airlines. Due to this we will book with easy jet for next october, same travel details £289 even with added cost of hold luggage and in flight snack still much cheaper than air frances offering. Sure its not an airbus and they dont always leave on time but staff are equally as nice and helpful. If i am going to get budget offering which usnt that budget friendly i may as well fly budget airline with budget price. Especially having read numerous reviews of a so call decline in service on air france.","2016-11-03"
"4","Short flight but very good","Nice flight, very friendly staff, enjoyed the experience. First time with Air France for 20 years but would fly again with them no problem.","2016-11-03"
"4","Excellent attention to detail!","For a little extra money flying Premium Economy is worth the cost differential. Express check-in at the gate, large comfortable seats and a choice of food and wine. The seats on the aircraft reclined but did not fold into the seat behind you.The cabin staff was attentive. This is the third time flying Air France and I was impressed again. We flew from Boston to Rome on Alitalia but not even in the same league!","2016-11-02"
"3","Premium Economy, you are having a laugh!","We have travelled PE with a number of airlines and not had a problem but what is Premium about this?  An overnight flight from Jo'burg to Paris and we thought this would be a bit better than Economy.

We had a seat that did not recline, okay it did about 3 inches but why bother?  The legroom was disappointing not as good as competitors at the same grade.  The food was okay, perhaps the best part of the flight (except for the breakfast but airlines do not do good breakfasts).

A nice refreshing hotel flannel is always a pleasure on a long-haul flight - it doesn't happen with Air France.

In-flight entertainment was poor, old films and a couple of new films.  Not good for such a long flight.

Not at all impressed","2016-11-02"
"2","Very dissatisfied","very dissatisfied by the ground staff and the policies of the airline that seem to be geared towards inconvenience towards travellers. The worst policies I have come across. I was once denied boarding even though I reached 18 minutes before departure time at the gate. And this is their standard practice. And when their flight is delayed they keep you waiting at the gate. I can't advice enough to avoid this airline and pay a little extra to fly something more reliable.","2016-11-02"
"5","Will always be one of the best airlines","I have been taking this airline for a very long time now. The best plane is the one with 2 floors. Seats are very spacious and comfortable. There is a lot of entertainment and the service is amazing.","2016-11-01"
"3","Didn't deliver on promised service","As a Flying Blue Member I contacted Air France ahead of our planned flight to arrange for champagne and other treats as we were going on holiday to celebrate our forthcoming 25th Wedding Anniversary. I was assured on my second phone call that all had been arranged and that we would be treated like VIP's on both legs of our trip. Imagine then our massive disappointment when we discovered that the staff on board our flight knew nothing about our Anniversary, no VIP package had been arranged and no VIP treatment was forthcoming - it certainly didn't make us feel very special or valued as a loyal customer.

When I contacted Air France/Flying Blue to complain I did get an apology by email but that was it - no 'we'll make it up to you next time', 'sorry, let us compensate you'. Just a 'you are a loyal and valued customer' - heads up guys - actions speak louder than words.

Having flown with Air France repeatedly over the last 6 years we have noticed a real decline in the service offered - the food, once fabulous is now very disappointing and the customer service is decidedly lacklustre. The in-flight movies often crash - stating that too many people are using it at the same time!!!! The planes are tired, with untidy and at times dirty cabins and the seats are long since past their best.

After this last trip, I won't be rushing to use them again","2016-11-01"
"2","Traveling with kids - Terrible airline choice","Warning long post:
I am writing this as a warning for people who are travelling with kids. For anyone without kids I don't think you would have a problem choosing this airline.
 I chose this company based on the info I read about travelling with a child on their site, which seemed like a great choice. Not the case. I traveled for the 1st time w a baby and did my homework on their site, called the airline asked all the questions I could think of. The person helping me on the phone wasn't very nice, but as long as I got the info I needed I didnt care, I am only mentioning it now bc its a complete review on my experience with AirFrance. I could not check in on line for all my flights due to travelling with a child (I think)
I traveled internationally from Newark to Budapest with a connecting flight in Paris. If you travel with a child they dont give you the boarding pass for the connecting flight, not sure if this is just AirFrance or all companies, but considering you are traveling with a child they should make it easier for you. Somehow in Paris they told me I no longer show on the connecting flight which was fully booked at this point and I may need to take a later one. After a long wait they confirmed we can get on what was our connecting flight from the beginning. Priority Boarding with kids is a joke, you have to squeeze your way up front, but I didnt care to be on the plane any longer than needed so I didnt even bother, but for some ppl this may be something they want. 

On our return we had more issues. I booked a flight for my mom to return with me. AirFrance guaranteed me we will be seated together as they marked us as a family in their system... but we had issues being seated together on both returning flights. They ended up working it out for us, but I was pretty disgusted with the attitude they gave us. Like it was our fault and they cared less... I was flying with a baby and my moms presence was a huge plus, and being seated apart would not cut it. On our return flight from Budapest to Paris they took our baby stroller when we got on the plane and when we got to Paris the stroller was gone. They told me I will get it at my final destination in Newark. I told them that's not ok as I have a layover in Paris that was 4.5 hrs. I needed that stroller for my son. Their answer was that I should have told them when they took it away that I needed it in Paris, now it was too late as it was moved with all the checked in luggage. I didnt even know I should have mentioned that as I already traveled once with them just a week prior and yes they took my stroller when I got on the plane but gave it back to me when I got off the plane (something I confirmed when I got my info on the phone)....well this was a small plane and they had to put my stroller down with the checked luggage. Ok how am I supposed to know that? 
They didn't even pretend to care. They kept saying I should have told them. So here I am in Paris carrying my 25 lbs baby around and pregnant, not the ideal situation. He only wanted me as my mom would have carried him. On the plane ride my son was watching baby songs on my phone, volume was pretty low and I asked ppl around if that bothers them. They couldn't even hear it and many of them had their earbuds on. One of the staff mentioned to me I should put ear buds on him so that I dont bother the others around. Seriously? on a 1.5 yr old? not even sure its ok for their small ears but even so like he will keep them on LOL she must not have kids. 
Out of all the staff members I dealt with, I finally got a SUPER nice one in Paris when we boarded for the Paris - Newark flight. She was the sweetest person. Too bad AirFrance doesnt have more like her. 
I am sorry to say AirFrance but I will avoid you anytime I am travelling with kids.","2016-11-01"
"4","Pleasant Flight","The flight was comfortable and the entertainment good, the staff was friendly, although I cant say the same for the passengers. I was even asked at the end of the flight if I enjoyed it and if I would change anything...this was the best flight I have had with air France.","2016-11-01"
"1","Budget airline code share with Air France","Saturday flight so Air France code share with Flybe

Flight delayed 35 minutes, they allow 1 hr 25 minutes for what is a 50 minute flight so really over an hour late

Food and drink charged for, this is poor when you pay Air France ticket prices and this flight is just a connecting flight","2016-10-31"
"5","Premium economy worth the price","Very worthwhile to spring for the upgrade. Our luggage arrived before we were at the carousel on one leg.  Great seats and food and beverage.  Pleasant staff.  Smooth flights.    Will definitely use again","2016-10-13"
"3","Home of the airbus and flying old planes.","Great aircrew. Food fair with a touch of France. Wine as you would expect good. Beds unfortunately not flat and being 186cm I found myself slipping down.","2016-10-12"
"1","vertical coffin all the way","Seating on this Air France flight was a nightmare. The term ""vertical coffin"" came to my mind.  I could not bend over to get my bag on the floor without asking my husband, sitting next to me, to get up.  There was hardly enough room for me horizontally, and I am a modestly sized person.  My knees hit the seat in front of me; I am 5' 5"". We did this through a package from Viking Cruise Lines. The cruise was first-class, but they could have done a lot better booking us into decent seats.  Also, it was clear that the toilet liquid had not been changed since the plane's last flight, or before, and absolutely stank. In addition, I am disabled and asked ahead of time to be met by a wheelchair.  Air France personnel were somewhere between indifferent and rude when I entered the airport asking for this accommodation.","2016-10-12"
"3","BUSSINESS CLASS SEAT DIRTY AND FALLING APART, VERY GOOD FOOD THAW","We were traveling in business class ,The seat was sticky and dirty , I had to ask for a wet towel to clean it myself , on my seat there were some pieces falling apart  and other seats in front, unbelievably  duck tape was used to hold the control of my seat and other pieces in a seats in front, Honestly I was worry about the overall maintenance of the plane. 
Even thaw food was excellent and service was OK, we will try to avoid flying with air France in the future.","2016-10-12"
"5","Great Flight","We flew economy but it felt like first class.  The seats were the regular small crowded ones smashed together like they usually do in economy class.  So that wasn't any different.  But the service and the food were exceptional.  First of all, all the stewards and stewardesses were extremely charming and attentive and out right friendly.  We had a good time talking to them and even exchanged our e-mail address with one of them.  But what makes the flight and the air line so exceptional is the food.  It came in the usual containerized package that you usually get on a flight.  But that's where the comparison ends.  This food tasted like real food and we had a choice between chicken and pasta for our main dish.  Both my wife and myself chose the chicken and it was delicious.  With the food we had a choice of drinks at no extra cost, including champagne.  Something you usually only get in first class on other air lines.  All in all, it was a marvelous flight both to and from Miami and we will fly Air France again when we get the chance.

"4","Air France","I was pleasantly surprised by the recent experience with Air France. The flight was very smooth with the timely departure and arrival. The plane itself was new and comfortable. The business seats are well situated and you have enough personal space. The TV selection is very good with so many choices to choose from. The food was adequate, with a good selection of alcoholic beverages. I would recommend this airline.","2016-10-11"
"5","Air France Pleasant Flying Experience","First time flying with Air France--would recommend this airline.Great service, meal and snack served","2016-10-11"
"4","Great Experience","Our last overseas trip we flew United. After that horrible experience, we vowed to only fly foreign airlines. Air France's premium economy seemed to offer the best deal in comfort, food and amenities. So glad we flew with them this time. The plane was the double decker, beautiful, immaculately clean with comfortable seats.

The flight attendants could give the United crew some valuable tips on customer service. AF attendants were friendly, attentive and efficient. All requests were met with a smile. The food was actually good and they kept the wine and champagne flowing. The in-flight entertainment looked good, but I preferred my book.

The flight was actually enjoyable. We would definitely fly with AF again.","2016-10-11"
"5","One of the best flight","One of the best flight ever bpoarded, the seats were confortable and the leg space was awesome, food was good beverages were good. Signature french wine was served which add on the happiness in the trip.
Overall good experience.","2016-10-10"
"4","Short hop on full flight but well looked after","Early flight with every seat booked. Despite it being very short flight the crew were friendly and very efficient. Space was OK and plane was bright and clean","2016-10-10"
"3","Premium economy just ok","Other than the slightly better seats not really worth it (except mine was covered with crumbs when I boarded). The food wasn't really pleasant. Served in plastic trays that you have to pull the foil off. The main course was chicken chunks with some white gravy, yuck. Cold hard rolls, I think the only thing that was decent was the lava cake. Also I don't know why when it is a day flight the cabin lights would go off after the food service (they stayed on in business). To prevent jet lag you are supposed to stay awake. Another thing that I wonder about it how come there aren't any air vents in the ceiling on Air France planes, sometimes it gets sweltering and a little AC would help.","2016-10-10"
"4","VERY GOOD BUT......","""Air France"" is a very good airline in every way except for me that is,it doesn't have the soft and personalized touch that you get from the staff on Asian based airlines.Besides that ,it's a good airline with good service,pleasant staff and comfortable seating.Let me put it this way,I would always  opt for an Asian based airline over a European based airline because of the reason given at the beginning and nothing else besides that.Basically I have travelled with a few European based airlines and they are all very good but.........","2016-10-10"
"3","Okay flight that was late due to a lot of people wit too much hand luggage","Delayed by 20 minutes. Long time to board due to people having too many bags as carry on. Small sandwich or wrap served with drinks. Seats comfortable with good leg room

Air France really need to be stricter with hand baggage and some people just take the mickey (common I know)","2016-10-10"
"3","Flight on time seat and service average","On time, quick boarding. Seats with poor legroom. Always shows 1hr 20 minutes for a 45 minute flight. Croissant and drink

Had an issue with my allocated seat at online check in but resolved by customer services","2016-10-10"
"4","Very good experience flying with Air France with children...very gentle crew.","Left on time and arrived on time.  Good service, gentle crew, everything nice in this
short flight.  Comfortable seats, clean aircraft.","2016-10-10"
"4","First time on AF, maybe not the last....","By seeking a combination of ""better-than-Economy-but-not-Business"" from Canada to Spain, I ended up with AF and their ""middle-class"" service.
A quick check with SeatGuru and other reviews showed PremEcon to be a valid option and managed to secure 4 seats at not much more than the cheap-seats in the back. (note: booked almost a year in advance)

Was not disappointed. The seat was as expected, lots of room, neat flexible reading lights, noise-cancelling headphones, a freakishly huge tray table and extra spots to store stuff.

The ""entertainment system"" worked fairly well, by touchscreen or pullout keypad, but needs a design/software upgrade to make it a bit more user-friendly. Lots of choices however.

The meal was quite acceptable and you can also pre-order a number of extra fancy ones at a cost on-line days before flight.

Drinks were at best ""adequate"" and at worst, they don't serve rum & cola which is an airline must-have, IMHO.

Being used to Premium or Biz seats on other airlines, the different PE seat design took some getting used to. The ""seat"" slides down in the fixed shell as opposed to ""recline"". But still caught some zzzz on the overnight flight.

The crew were pleasant and helpful.

Our check-in at YYZ was quick and pain-free. Pays to get there early and pays to be Sky Priority.
Our connection at CDG was a bit of a trial, but this is not the fault of AF.
Our return check-in at AGP was ok and Air Europa (the AF SkyTeam partner) observed all the AF allowances for Sky Priority access, baggage, etc.
Our return connection at CDG was a very brisk walk (part run) between terminals, but this again was not the fault of AF.
Due to the super short connex in Paris, all our luggage missed the plane, but AF did notify me by text message upon arrival at YYZ before we even made it to Canada Customs.
A very nice KLM chap at the arrivals service counter took care of matters and everything arrived the next night to our house as promised.

Overall, I would definitely recommend AF from Canada, based on the PremEcon service, especially if Paris is your destination. Connecting at CDG can be a nightmare.

The only complaint I can muster is that at CDG and AMS, PE pax get access to the AF / KLM business lounges, BUT if your connection flight is regarded as Econ by the next airline, you'll be denied entry. Air France needs to address this matter asap!","2016-10-08"
"5","Air France","On time, excellent assistance at Lyon airport.  Friendly flight attendants.  No complaints about flight or staff.","2016-10-08"
"5","Efficient attendants","Wow!  This airline is efficient.  We boarded the plane well, in a really short flight that an American airline wouldn't serve food on due to length of flight, we were served very delicious sandwiches and drink.  I will uses this airline again.  Flight to/from were both very good.","2016-10-08"
"4","One of the better airlines","Clean tidy friendly and spacious seats. Good food and did not have to pay for extras.
Staff were very nice.","2016-10-08"
"5","one of the best","It was a very nice experience to fly with Air France. The food was excellent! My kids liked the flight attendance for getting lots of attention. The seats were comfortable.","2016-10-07"
"4","Enjoyable flight","Watching first-run movies on the back of the seats made the time fly by. Also having a real lunch and snacks during the flight made it more enjoyable. While Economy seat comfort was nothing to brag about, it was OK, even for a 10 hour flight.","2016-09-28"
"5","Tahiti flight","I have flown numerous times. This was the first international flight. This was the best most comfortable flight ever with superior flight attendants. I love this airline. Even the hot airline food was pretty good..","2016-09-28"
"2","Customer Experience is not a care at Air France a Delta partner","We arrived at the airport in Paris 2 1/2 hours before flight time and Air France kept us waiting in line for and hour and 15 minutes before we could check our bags.  Upon complaining to a supervisor at Delta, they passed the buck to Air France.  I stated that it was a Delta partner flight and I booked with Delta.  They didn't care.  I found an Air France supervisor and pointed out the growing line that wasn't going anywhere.  I wanted to go to the airport lounge inside but I was stuck on their baggage line.  They didn't care and said their staff comes to work at 10:15 and there was no one to man the counter before that.  Wonderful planning by the airlines.  The flight was on time and the service was adequate.  The Airbus had individual satellite including movies during the flight and there were AC/ USB outlets at all seats.  Upon arriving at JFK, we waited 45 minutes for the bags to come out, and that was after deplaning and walking 15 minutes through the terminal downstairs.  Not a great customer experience and management that treated us like cattle.","2016-09-28"
"5","What a joyous change!","I've been flying for over 50 years, all over the world on every sort of airline and plane. I fly overseas several times a year.  You get pretty jaded after a while, and the ""romance"" of travel is long gone. So imagine what 10.5 hours in what was practically the perfect flight was like. From the moment I got on the plane, they stewards and stewardesses pampered you, became your friends, attended to your every need and whim.  The caliber of service was what PanAm's or BOAC's was 50 years ago. So gracious, so warm, so helpful—I didn't think it was possible to find any more. And miles ahead of every American carrier.  Only KLM is in the same league, and they still don't come close.  The quality of the champagne and wines was pure connoisseur, and they tell you every detail of the vintage (try the ChateauNeuf de Pape, Rouge Robe). To say the food was gourmet isn't even close. It was spectacular. Several courses, several varieties of desserts, all carefully chronicled in the brilliant menus.  It wasn't only better than any other airline food, it was better than almost any restaurant I've ever entered.  Both stewards and stewardesses weren't just friendly, they were like long-lost relatives at a family reunion.  Normally, when we land, I can't wait to get off the plane. This time, I didn't want to leave. From now on, I'm an Air France customer.","2016-09-28"
"5","My favorite","Flying business class with Air France includes very attentive flight attendants, delicious food and drinks and wonderfully comfortable seating. Worth every penny.","2016-09-28"
"3","Beware the food!","The flight was wonderful; boarding, etc., but halfway through my breakfast, a cockroach comes crawling out.  I caledl the attendant, and while I was assured a complaint/issue report would be filed, no other meal was offered.  Needless to say, after that I thoroughly checked everything I ate or drank on the rest of my flights.","2016-09-28"
"2","NEW YORK TO PARIS VIA AIR FRANCE HORROW SHOW.","Seats very uncomfortable !
Minimum recline.
Food slapped on our tray with total unconcern.
The food was not eatable.
We tried for over 45 minutes to get the trays of
pig food removed from out chair.
It took another 30 minutes to get drinks for my
wife and I. So they they were free, they would

"1","Equipment not maintained","Bottom line is that in Premium there was no air circulation, and unknown to me, two cats in the cabin.  For a person with COPD and animal allergies, I endured nine hours of torture.  Air France loffered to reseat me back in steerage.....are you kidding me.  I paid them for a service which was not given and would NEVER fly them or their partner Delta..""excuse me but to those seated on the right side of the aircraft, you might notice that a piece of an access panel to the wing is missing.""

"4","new business class service to Singapore","This is a new bc seat with flat bed. I appreciated the audio headset that is stored in a specific mini side stowage and dont required plugging. The new meal service is being put in place with meals served individually at the table. The drawback is that they are many venues of the crews to check when they can serve nextvdished. The standard of food as raised from the past.. the video system is great and the screen agreable to settle.","2016-09-28"
"1","Terrible experience","The plane took off from Rabat after 5 hours late, which made me lose my connecting flight to Montreal. The worst part is that I had breathing difficulties and I had my two kids with me. So they called an ambulance when we arrived to Paris Charles degaules aeroport and I am left without assistance. I had to look for an open Air France desk to have my voucher for the hotel and then go to the hotel without any assistance.
I file a complaint and I get as an apology a grocery cart with coffee, dried fruits, tea. A real shame it looks like a supermarket not a so-called airline.","2016-09-28"
"4","Flight to Paris","Our flight was great except for the landing in Paris which was very rough.  The flight crew were very attentive.  Was a little surprise that Air France did not honor our TSA Pre at check in.  But since we were flying business class that turned out not to be a problem.","2016-09-28"
"5","great flight, great people","the flight was on time and attendants were great.  Food was excellent; not at all like ""airline"" food.  We had a lot of choices for movies, etc.  Seats were spacious.  We have flown this route 3 times now and always with Air France!","2016-09-28"

I would definitely take Air France again. Their airbus luggage bins are very large and our carry on suitcases fit easily. The flight crew was very hospitable.","2016-09-28"
"4","Premium Economy worth the extra $$$","We flew AF Premium Economy nonstop roundtrip from San Francisco to Paris.  Outbound was on an A380; return was on a 777.  Overall the experience was quite nice, and a distinct step up from Economy.  Food was good overall but better on the return flight, where they can source higher-quality French ingredients like cheese.  On the other hand, the flight itself was better on the A380, where the PE seats are on the upper deck.  Not sure if it's the location or the plane design, but the A380 flight was one of the quietest I've ever experienced.

Service was friendly and courteous on both legs and the flight attendants seemed to be enjoying their job.  The seats are roomy compared to coach but do not recline fully.  They do have an adjustable foot rest and lower-leg support.  The A380 includes storage between the window seat and the fuselage for items like briefcases, pillows, and jackets.  

PE includes priority baggage service (first bags out) and access to priority security lines.  Both sped our trip through the terminal; combined with Global Entry it took us only 15 minutes to get from the plane to the curb at SFO.","2016-09-28"

"2","Lost Luggage, Terrible Food, Incomptent Airline","This is my first experience with Air France and I can confidently tell you that it was my worst flight experience. I travelled with Emirates often and I usually find their services satisfying and I have no problems after the flight. Like I said, the food was average but I was content with customer service. The only thing that I find rememberable and worth complimenting is the fact the Air France had the best Flight Safety Video! Anyways my luggage was delayed after coming back from my trip and I was annoyed how they dealt with  my situation. I phoned several times to speak to their advisor who was dealing my bag and I found them incompetent at their job. I was told that the compensation helpline would contact me after filling out my inventory form however they never made contact. Therefore I made contact with advisor the week after asking for the compensation phone number to attempt to call helpline. I was paticurally annoyed at this stage of my compensation claim. In the end, I received a compensation but my luggage and valuables are still missing. No offence but I'm a guy who rarely gets mad but I was raging after my dreadful experience with Air France. Grrr!","2016-09-28"

"1","Pathetic Service","We took flight from Mumbai to Paris on 8th Sept 
Such a long flight we had horrible experience
1 food was lousy we had ordered one jain food they did not bother to ask

2 no alcoholic drinks were served or displayed on trolley one had to ask if available 

3 aircraft was old rattling one.

4 inflight entertainment was pathetic and worst of all the flights we have taken world over with different airlines

5 inflight attendend when asked for masala tea said he will have to inquire if the air hostess had served it earlier as if he was sponsoring the beverage that was rude and arrogant behaviour we kept quiet cause we were on vacation and not sure how will they treat on arrival n transfers.

We would never recommend Air France from India to any destination.

I booked well in advance and the connecting times were changed a couple of times, meaning a longer layover in Paris, but the Paris lounge has couches in a quiet room. All round good flight.","2016-09-27"
"4","Great Exp","I was flying back to India from Paris on the day of Diwali n i was amazed to see that AF had decorated their boarding gate. They also provided some flower garlands & sweets to all the passengers. the food was really good compared to economy along with other in-flight service","2016-09-27"
"5","WHAT A PLEASURE","What an excellent flight.  There was nothing to fault.  Seating, service, entertainment and food all excellent.","2016-09-27"
"4","europe vacation","Air France staff was on strike at the time, but the temp staff was most friendly and accommodating.
Everything was under control and perfect. Well done.","2016-09-27"
"4","warm smiles, cold air","We flew with an infant, and the personnel was really helpful to explain and patient with us young parents, fumbling about with the bed or seat buckle. The food was ok, and the in-flight entertainments very diverse and up-to-date, with good displays (but a very sad lack of subtitled versions).

HOWEVER: even in the dead of summer, the the temperature inside the plane was polar, and using two blankets, a sweater and a scarf barely prevented me from freezing to death.","2016-09-27"
"5","French Riviera visit","We travelled via air France to Nice and I couldn't fault them. Their timings were on point, their on board service was excellent and aircrafts pristine. The trip to Nice via Paris and back was a memorable one.","2016-09-27"
"4","first time!!","its was first time to used air france,and we choose the 12 hours layover, so we had a chance to go in the city to visit Eiffel tower.for whole day...the service was fabulous,even thou plane was not that new still fine.","2016-09-27"
"5","La dolce vita à la Français","Early morning rise, for a long travel day, but Air France made it worth while.  Flying is much more enjoyable when you experience the French sophistication and class on board.","2016-09-27"
"5","Always a pleasure","This is a short 2 hr. Flight.  All went smoothly and easy.
Air France is always our choice if available","2016-09-27"
"5","Great experience","I flew nonstop from lax to Paris and had the greatest experience with the premium economy ticket. The advantages were that when you checkin you get a special that is usually no waiting, you get two suitcases, priority seating, bigger seats, better food, faster luggage pickup at the airport. Coming back from Paris  there was even a faster line for the weapons screening area. The lines you go into are Sky Priority. Great experience and worth the extra cash.","2016-09-26"
"2","Not impressed.","This was a really bad experience for me. My flight was delayed for over 4 hours causing me to miss all my connections. While Air France finally made it right after about 8 hours, they need to understand that a croissant and a fruit pie are not adequate nourishment in a 12 hour period. I was, however, very thankful for the hotel even if it was only for 5 hours.
Next day, I was happy to be rerouted and flying with KLM.","2016-09-26"
"4","The 777-300 Business Class is A Great Experience","After a disappointing flight on the A380, we loved the business class experience on the 777-300. Both the service and cabin were what we expect in business class. The crew personally greeted each business class passenger; champagne or juice were offered pre-flight; service of food/drink was generous and of high quality. The seats are ""pod-like"" and modern. Great lighting, storage, television and comfort when lying flat. Just a really nice experience.","2016-09-26"
"4","Avoid the Large A380 for Business Class- Total Disappointment","We are regular Air France customers. If you are flying business class, I highly recommend you avoid the A380 flight from LA to Paris. The business class service was marginal (nothing offered pre-flight and totally average service in flight- not a typical Air France experience. I would venture to say the crew had a bad attitude towards the business class passengers.) Worse, the cabin of this plan is old (there is no privacy, no storage for the passenger on the aisle and the seats do not get anywhere near flat.) I was so uncomfortable after 12 hours, I arrived in Lyon feeling terrible.  Given the price, very disappointing.  I would never choose the A380 again (unless a major update is coming.)","2016-09-26"
"4","My first Air France flight - and I liked it","This has been my first flight on Air France - and from what I've heard you either love it or hate it.

My experience was definitely very good; the online-check in worked perfectly, the luggage drop off took a bit longer than necessary (there was only 1 counter opened, and it seems a full school class was checking-in before me), but staff, both on the ground and on the plane, were really friendly, the flight was slightly delayed upon departure, plane was clean - just lacking some leg room, which I always appreciate even if I'm only 1.70m.","2016-09-26"
"3","no white wine? you are kidding","This was my first air France flight and I was expecting the very best in food and wine. To my disappointment both were a plain average but, what made it worse was, on the return leg they had to admit to my wife that they had no white wine - and this is air France for heaven's sake!","2016-09-26"
"1","Another terrible experience","Ok, the same treatment on flight, the same bad food but the plane was totally disgusting. So when you take your seat and then when you arrive to your destination and found a bubblegum stuck in your pants ""IS SO DISGUSTING!!"" I found also different evidences of  dirty in this flight like in the previous one, but please i title bit of respect with the passengers. Unacceptable!!","2016-09-26"
"2","Terrible service at the airport and during the fight","It's not the first time I fly with Air France. After a year i have to use again the company and i saw nothing change, the staff at the airport don't speak english and they don't make any effort to help you. In flight the is humiliated how the ""flight attendants"" talk to you, how express to you. The snack is terrible, and if you don't want (in my case because im allergic to eggs) they don't give you any options and take the food from your hands, and don't offer any options. The plane was smelly and dirty, no excuses. I mean I payed for a ticket, yes in economy but doesn't mena that you be treated like nothing. I think is the last time I go to use this company time by time is falling down.","2016-09-26"
"3","Mixed Bag from Heaven to Hell","I had a wonderful flight to Paris - very comfortable and luxurious. I was in Heaven.
Coming home was another story. I got caught in their air strike and had to endure going to the airport EVERYDAY for 7 days only to be told to go back to my hotel in Paris. This COSTS a lot of money and took most of my day. I could have at least enjoyed Paris while waiting for the strike to end. 
Air France handled the strike very poorly for its passengers. There were many other ways to have dealt with the situation - ones that would have put the passengers first.
In addition - we were all told that we would receive monetary compensation for our extra hotel bills, daily transport to airport and back, plus meals and a flat $300 per day on top of expenses. It has been TWO years and I have yet to receive ONE PENNY.
Also, on the (finally) return flight, I was forced to fly in economy without receiving the price difference of my Business ticket.
So, I has both in Heaven and Hell with Air France - Hell lasted much longer!","2016-09-25"
"2","Extremely cramped, dreadful, snooty staff","None of the staff smiled at anyone from the moment we got on the plane until one smiled as she said goodbye.
No choice of meals were offered, the meal service only came with a limited choice of soft drinks and wine - which was pretty un-drinkable. To be fair, the chicken pasta dish tasted nice, and contained a single piece of chicken which was around 3 cm long and 1 cm wide. The bread roll was very dry and hard. Breakfast was awful - a small piece of pineapple and two small pieces of overripe watermelon, 2 hard dry rolls and marmalade.
Legroom was appalling - there was less space than on the following Flybe flight, which wasn't great for a long haul flight. My husband is 6 foot and his knees touched the seat in front and when the passenger in front reclined, they knocked the glasses off the table.
The seats were dirty and the toilets had no paper towels. 
The flight left on time and the inflight entertainment was fine,
It was our first time with air France and will be the last, if the customer service is always this poor.","2016-09-08"
"4","Confirm your flight","I would recommend this airline to anyone BUT with a word of caution.  Air France and Delta are connected.  We booked with Air France and for 3 months thought we had a flight and seats.  We had a confirmation number.  2 weeks before we left we were told our flight was cancelled.  On calling Delta, it seems communication with Air France is lacking and they had not been notified of our flight.  There were four of us and we did get the same flight with the same dates but unfortunately we did not get the same seats.  Once you book, do a follow up in several days, or weeks, to be sure.  They staff on board was excellent, the entertainment offered excellent, and the food plentiful.  We were very pleased with the main flight of JFK to Prague.  The Columbus - New York potion of the flight , not so impressive.  My answer to the survey pertains to the JFK-Prague portion.  The CMH-JFK would be all ones!","2016-09-08"
"5","Great customer service","When booking the return flight, connections didn't link up properly.  It worked online but not in reality.  Air France spent an hour before we boarded working with our partner airline to get us home on time.  They had the connecting plane held for us and staff waiting to help us once we landed.  FYI this flight routinely is retimed for a later departure so if you need to make intenational connections be aware to give youself extra time.  Very nice staff!","2016-09-08"
"5","Very good service (and support service)","Nothing to add that Air France was perfect
Service during the flight was high quality, the possibility to have the dinner in the lounge at JFK is a real plus to enjoy the flat seat during the night. 
After a very bad experience on another skyteam company between YVR and JFK (no service at all) this flight on AF was strongly appreciate. 
As frequent traveler I often encounter issues and Air France  client services has always find a correct arrangement (miles, luggage replaceted or repaired etc.)
As much as I can I try to fly with them. Only one bad point they discriminate French residents for the point level of their frequent flyer status.","2016-09-08"
"4","Very Good Overall","Food was good, a choice was available.  Seating was a bit crowded but not as bad as other airlines.  Flight left and arrived on time, and baggage retrieval was prompt.","2016-09-08"
"4","Round trip, well done","Flying to and from Seattle to Paris was a long flight. Air France did a great job! We had great snacks and a good breakfast before we landed in france. The most leg room that I have ever had in economy. Had a window seat and it was great. Attendants were very helpful  and friendly.","2016-09-08"
"2","Buyer Beware","When buying tickets on Air France's website be aware that when seats remaining is shown means seats at that price and not the flight. We were unaware of this and purchased seats thinking there were only four seats left. Later we learned we could have saved $250. for the same fight a week later.","2016-09-08"
"4","mainly good but the air conditioning is so cold, they are prone to staff withdrawing there services plus on a recent","flight to paris was fine but spoilt by using othere suppliers for the final leg. The journey out had to be transfered as they had no cabin crew","2016-09-08"
"3","The Good, the Bad and the Lost Luggage","A short flight to Paris resulted in a major headache. Not only did one of my bags (a large duffle bag filled with rock climbing gear) not make it to Paris. It disappeared completely. (I suspect a baggage handler stole my stuff) At any rate, I followed the protocol for itemizing my bag's contents and submitting a claim. Shortly after returning home, I received an email from Delta, which handles Air France claims for customers residing in the US. It informed me that I would be paid for the full amount I had claimed (over $1000) and a check arrived a few days later. I was very satisfied with the result and the process had been easy to navigate. Delta and Air France did a great job.","2016-09-08"
"1","Extremely Poor service continually on EVERY flight taken with Air France","Have NEVER yet had anything good to say about Air France (AF).
Cancelled flights, late flights, re routed flights EVERY TIME we have flown with then but the end is nigh will never use them again.
Sister partner KLM are SO much better to fly with and rarely had any issue with them.
Spending a fortune on BUSINESS class flights for long haul and Economy if flying Europe and they either CANCEL or CHANGE to unsuitable times without so much as a phone call. Then have to spend hours sometimes DAYS getting things sorted to our satisfaction and AF staff could not care less.
Would now rather fly anyone else than use Air France again.","2016-09-08"
"1","Long Haul De Gaulle To Cuba and not a glass of water to be had","The Single worst airline I have ever flown with. Holds the record, I have tried quite a few. It was about a 14/16 hour flight. We (the passengers) were served a meal like cattle, then crew disappeared for the next 5 hours. Could not even get a glass of water. Food was really average as well. But the worst was, I even went to the Galley to see about a glass of water and literally there was no one around. When they appeared again, they were to busy chatting to each other to notice the queue of people waiting to ask for stuff. NEVER ever again.","2016-09-08"
"2","Do not wast your money on Premium Economy on Air France.","Premium economy on this airline is horrible.  It is the worst airline seat I have ever sat in regardless of airline, seat class, or aircraft.  I have sat in more comfortable seats on 50 passenger regional aircraft.

My rear end was numb before we even left the gate.  It is torture to be in this seat for an overnight flight (JFK-CDG).  We landed and connected with a tiny airplane (AvroLiner 85) to complete our journey, and I actually slept 2 hours on the tiny plane because the regular economy seat was more comfortable than the Premium Economy seat on AF A380!!!

I cannot believe that AF has the audacity to call this a Premium Economy seat.  I won't get into details of how this seat is designed.....you can Google it for yourself.  Put it this way.....I was willing to sacrifice our seats on our planned return trip (AF CDG-JFK on B777 also Premium Economy) and buy a brand new one-way ticket home just so I wouldn't be tortured all the way home in this seat.  

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON AF PREMIUM ECONOMY!!","2016-09-08"
"1","Another air France","Mishandling of our luggage! Every time we fly through Paris we lose our luggage and today is no different! And to top it off the pilots and the flight attendants lied to us! It's a shame people can't be honest. I will never fly air France again.","2016-09-08"
"1","The worst airline company in the whole world !!!!","Strikes in Paris, we could not leave eventhough our flight left !!!
After waiting for about 6 hours standing in front of the reception counters,  we've been rerouted for a departure 2 days later !!!
still no refund eventhough I have created a file 6 weeks ago.
This company is a total shame, I have travelled a lot around the world and I have never experienced any problem with any other airline, believe me !!!","2016-09-08"
"3","Worst last year","They are late,we miss a fly for Sofia,they put us at fly through Romania,they loos our luggage,the service was terrible,the space like for baby's,the staff terrible
And didn't ask excuse at least","2016-09-07"
"4","Air France","Air France is a great Airline!!! When I board the plane I always ask the crew to only speak French to me. And they always do. They are so nice to do that for me. The food is consistently good. The seats in Business Class are comfortable. I really enjoy my trips with Air France.","2016-09-07"

Seat uncomfortable-- didn't recline
Broken TV
Broken Earphones

"1","Lost luggage, terrible customer service","Air France have lost our luggage on 3 occasions in 5 months!

The first time in April we travelled to Euro disney for our daughters birthday, we received our cases within 48hrs & was refunded for purchases made however we missed half a day in the park trying to find and waiting for the case etc.

The 2nd time, In July the cases didnt arrive until 5 days later which was too late as we had flown to our next destination (not with air france!) The cases were delivered to the UK when we were actually in France even though we had given them the French address!

The 3rd time (only 8 days later) in July we travelled to New york for my husbands 50th and guess what...... they lost them again!!!! 
The case was delivered within 48 hrs again however we are now £1600 out of pocket due to various purchases we needed to make and are still awaiting a refund/explanation after 7 weeks!

We have been passed from the Middle east ""customer care"" to the UK ""customer care"" at the end of July but still heard nothing back.......apparently they are inundated with complaints!

Certainly wont be using Air France again and will probably end up seeking legal advice as I am now being charged £26 interest each month!!!!!

The service on Air France is usually ok however on our last flight it wasn't great and combined with the luggage incidents I would certainly not recommend them!
We are frequent flyers so have experienced a few different airlines!","2016-08-21"
"3","Expected more","Appart from the typical delay in the flight (I must say, every time I had to fly with Air France, there were always delays...) I was completly unimpressed with the food they gavr. It was lunch time and while in some airlines they give us a nice decent meal, I just got a really lousy sandwich...","2016-08-21"
"3","Delicious food, miserable seats!","Air France now runs KLM.  Both are fully reputable airlines.  Both offer miserable, repeat miserable seating!  Tight, cramped, difficult to get out of, planes regularly full so bathroom breaks are bothersome for everyone.  Bathrooms as with other airlines could be much larger: an airplane architect said ""There's lots of room on planes; no reason for minuscule bathrooms.""  

I'm not all negative here, readers.  The mushroom risotto was to die for!  It made me make it at home.  Service was friendly if not attentive or even intrusive.  Isles were narrow, so isle seats caused you to be bumped and pummeled with carts and attendants for 6 hours across the pong.  My main complaint, however, is the seating, so woefully inadequate--even disrespectful of the basics for Air France customers, who ""pay the freight"", it is almost shocking.","2016-08-21"
"5","excellent service business class","very good crew on board
i lve the best cabins with A 380.

perfect timing for connecting flights

undeniable quality of food and wine.","2016-08-21"
"1","Clothesless in Cuba","Our baggage did not arrive with us at Havana.  OK these things happen, but Air France failed to deliver our bags to us for 10 days.  Cuba is not an easy country to purchase basic essentials.  We were refunded the cost of what we could find to purchase but no further compensation.","2016-08-21"
"4","Good flight","This was a good flight with good in-flight service and choice of movies and series for a person to watch.","2016-08-21"
"1","check in luggage pricing poor, a real rip off.","The flight itself was OK, no problems.  The check in was a pain-all automated-I had not used them before.  The complaint I had was ridiculous fees for carryon baggage.  I checked two bags and paid the fees which I expected.  When going thru the security line carrying two carry on small bags they were pulling everybody out and WEIGHING  the carry on baggage.  I was in Europe for 25 days, had clothing souvenirs, etc.  The weight limit was only 25 pounds and I was barely over.  Since when does the weight matter?  They will still weigh the same whether in cabin or checked.  Just about every other person was told their baggage was too heavy and they had to go back and check one of the bags.  I and a lot of other people were really mad.  This was nothing but a money grabbing scheme.  Flew American airlines with the same luggage and it was never weighed or questioned.  I wound up paying more for the luggage than I did for the plane ticket!!!  You won't see me on Air France ever again.","2016-08-20"
"3","LA PUE !!!","Brought tickets in March 2016.   Upon our arrival found out we were on STANDBYE .
 Was told "" because of the STRIKE ( $%&#@) Wanted till about 17 min before the flight left that we got a seat. Was also told "" Our Luggage was in the System"" well No Luggage in Spain  24 hrs later. But  on the other hand felt that air France did a good  security check","2016-08-20"
"5","Fantastic service","Lovely staff and excellent meals.  In flight entertainement had lots to chose from. We traveled from the Uk to Charles de Gaul and then on to New York.  After transfering to a different airline for our final destination we realised just how good the arline was.  The staff were curtious and ver attentive and obliging.  the aircraft was clean and fresh blankets and pillows.","2016-08-20"
"5","BEST Business class Cabin","This was my first time to sample AF's new BEST business class on one of their B777. The layout is in the angled format, with 1-2-1 seating. Not the best if you are travelling as a couple, as no two seats are really side-by-side. Otherwise, the word to use is excellent. The in flight entertainment is to a high standard, with a very large selection of media to watch / listen.

The on board service is nothing other than excellent. The AF team go that little extra to make sure all is OK with the flight. This level of service is way above many of the other ""legacy carriers"" in Europe.

The food service is as expected from a French airline also to a high standard with a good level of choices.

Definitely to be recommended.","2016-08-20"
"4","Smooth flight","It was the last leg of my return to Dubai...pretty smooth had to collect boarding pass in Paris very friendly service and fast. Service on board was great too. No problems","2016-08-19"
"4","Old plane, good sleep nonetheless","Old 777 in 2-3-2 constellation still, so not ideal. Entertainment system not too good thus (headphones sound was equalling ear-rape), so decided the nap after the (amazingly good: Air France) meal and slept like a baby. So mixed bag of feelings: old plane, old interior (one of the last 777 ones with this interior apparently), staff is very nice, flight timely...","2016-08-19"
"4","One of my favorites","It was fine. Boarding on time. Of course, they tell you the flight is one hour and forty-five minutes long so when they are late, they are still on time.  The flight is 55 minutes long. I can sit anywhere for 2 hours. Service at the counter was great as usual.  Paris Charles de Gaulle is not my favorite airport to be in especially when I am in transit, so this was fine, my end stop being Paris itself","2016-08-19"
"4","Less than four star airlines","I took the flight from Paris to JFK roundtrip with A380.  This is the least comfortable A380 I've ever used.  The seat pitch is narrow and the aircraft already looked old.  The onboard entertainment is good with lots of movie and music choices.  The crews are friendly and for Paris-JFK section is all male crew.  This is the first time.  Meals is not really good and they just used plastic plate,  spoon,  knife anx fork.  For Paris-JFK,  flight arrived on time while the return flight,  flight takeoff is two hours late and caused our arrival in Paris is two hours late.  ","2016-08-18"
"4","Buenos Aires-Paris and back","We flied last July from Buenos Aires to Paris in Economy class and found it much more comfortable than other airlines (i.e. Lufthansa, British Airways) in a long haul flight to Europe. There is more space for the legs, maybe not so many cm, but they make a difference to let you sleep (I have slept many hours, thing that I have never been able to do before). We reserve two aisle seats at the back of the plane (32€ each), just to be alone, but there is also a little bit of extra space between the seat and the window, so you can put your rucksack there. The only con is that you are one of the last to eat. Also, the offer of tv programs and movies is very good, and the screens seemed to be new. Check-in was possible even before than the 30 hours specified. I will try to travel with Air France from Buenos Aires to Europe next time because it had made me a difference.","2016-08-18"
"5","The prefect way to fly","This was the first time we were ever flying premium economy. Some people say it's just economy class with more legroom. But they were wrong. The seats are nice and wide, with plenty of legroom and a good reclining pitch. It is hard at first to find a comfortable position to sleep in but once you get there it's amazing. An amenity kit is given out which was very useful. The food was definitely a class of its own. The service was great with all the flight attendants having big smiles on their faces and catering to all your needs. Absolutely perfect for a 9 hour journey.

The only drawback would be is that to use the bathroom you have to walk all the way back to the economy cabin which takes a lot of time. Otherwise I would definitely fly on Air France again and recommend it to anyone flying to that side of the world.","2016-08-18"
"2","Will try not to use again !!","Recently flew Paris Milan in Business Class.

Lounge at Paris is terrible  - very basic.

Flight delayed 2 hours - no one kept us updated in the lounge.  We had to walk up to the gate to find out what was happening.

Staff in lounge rude.

Not the best experience!!!","2016-08-18"
"4","Pleasant flight","Have flown with Air France several times within Europe and to Asia, and each time the experience was very pleasant. The planes were updated/new, crew was polite, and service was satisfactory. They provided a light lunch/snack between Paris and Zurich (only 1 hour flight), which I didn't expect - I had bought food before the flight thinking about American domestic flights. Will continue to fly with Air France.","2016-08-18"
"4","Good flight","I have just taken the first leg of my return to Mumbai on AF 7727. A nice quick flight with everything on time. Good service. ","2016-08-18"
"5","First class flight and service","The flight left and arrived early and the cabin service was perfect. The aircraft was newly renovated or appeared to be. The offered sandwich was of good quality. A pity two of our bags were lost but that may or may not have been Air France's fault. They were at least delivered home next morning.","2016-08-18"
"4","Good Inflight Entertainment","Before my flight, I heard that Air France was not good. I was a bit worried, but with its reasonable price, I chose it finally. After my flight, I think it's a good airline. The services and the environment were good, though the food sucks! One thing I really like it most is the huge choice of inflight entertainment. I would recommend this airline to friends! Superb!","2016-08-09"
"4","Cancelled flight - disastrous airport in Venice","Our original flight was cancelled. Getting us on another flight from Marco Polo Airport in Venice was a disaster!  The airport is a shambles! We did manage to get a flight.
Once on board the experience was good. Cabin crew were pleasant and the snack for a short flight was adequate.","2016-08-09"
"1","Horrible do not fly","The flight was late due to then forgetting to put on the dinner trays. We arrived 2 hours late. Missed my connecting flight and was stuck in NY overnight. They were suppose to have people to help those of us trying to make connecting flights there to help us get through customs quicker. That was a lie. No one there to help or direct us. Not that it would have helped me at that point. Luggage was coming off the plane at a rate of 2 pieces every 2 mins approximately. They were rude and unapologetic. The stewardesses were rude and condescending. Horrible experience. Will never use them again.","2016-08-09"
"3","Undeserved good reputation","It seems Air France enjoys a good reputation among the ""big players"" airlines. But while the service cannot be faulted, there are now huge numbers of smaller airlines to choose from, that offers similar (or better) services at usually cheaper rates. Leg room, food quality and choice of media is satisfying, not mind blowing. As with low-cost airlines, you now have to pay extra to choose a special seat (at the rear, close to exit...) which I find rather cheap!","2016-08-09"
"3","Late Arriving / Late Leaving","We just took a non stop flight to Paris for vacation.
The plane was late leaving JFK by almost one hour.
On the return trip we had the same experience, late 1 hour from Paris to JFK..

This is typical for any flight or airline owned by Delta.
Delta is the worst.","2016-08-09"
"3","Just Ok","This airline was ok but nothing great and nothing too horrendous.  The food wasn't the best with the exception of breakfast when I got a croissant.  Some of the flight attendants were nice and friendly and others were just plain rude.  If the plane was a newer model the experience would have been a little bit better.","2016-08-09"
"1","Poor Service","Old aircraft (still they have ashtrays on the seats). Toilets were out of service so passengers had to sue to go to toilet.
They even couldn't organise a wheelchair for my father and he had to walk to the airplane at the last minute.
The food was also low quality.
I don't recommend this airline at all","2016-08-09"
"2","Unhelpful Air Stewards","Air stewards treated customers like they were doing us a favour whenever help or assistance was asked for. Requests were often met with a roll of the eyes! The return KLM, flight from Havana to Amsterdam provided excellent customer service from their stewards.","2016-08-09"
"5","Excellent as always!","Air France doesn't disappointed me never. The flight was smooth, we even arrived 15 minutes earlier. Classy, comfortable, nice service, good entertainment and they have the best video with instructions for passengers, tres chic! Food is great.","2016-08-09"
"4","Good but expensive","The flight was amazing, the food was nice and the people on the plane were very polite. The only negative point is the price which was over 1100 for a round trip.","2016-08-09"
"2","Not the best choice","1) Flight attendand's attitude was questionable at least and not very warm. 
2) Food was average and they ""didn't have on board"" my vegetarian diet. 
3) The most annoying thing about Air France is their approach if your baggage is damaged... After months, my gf's new backpack is still not repaired or replaced, despite our endless effort. 

I CANNOT RECOMMEND AIR FRANCE.","2016-08-09"
"3","Terrible experience through due to striking pilots","Flight canceled, day before! Due to striking pilots of this Air France pilots. Shameful to do so in middle of holiday season. These pilots a very well paid and still it is not enough!
The company forced me to fly one day earlier, my car reservation was automatically canceled, Had to pay more. A lot of hassel!","2016-08-09"
"2","Probably better - but not while strikes","We had a seat next to an emergency exit, so we paid 70 Euro extra for that, all in all I would not book this extra leg room with this airline again. The emergency exit seats are directly next to the kitchen and the toilet, the lights are never turned off, theres always traffic and the preparation is always loud. Sadly on our flight with the Airbus A380 we had only 12 of 21 stewards, because of a labor strike. We had no warm dishes, a terrible breakfast with triple cheese, horrible yoghurt and one old breadroll. Dinner was cold chickenbreast, salad and pudding.
The stewards where, even though that there have been less, pretty nice and helpful, but sadly they where coming around exactly 3 times for the whole 11 hours flight, drinks - dinner - breakfast. Trash was collected once by a customer and drinks where free for selfservice at the bar. The toilets where always clean.
The onboard system was old and used, the monitor of my neighbour was always falling down and didnt hold on its own, so she had to hold in with her hand while watching a movie. The availability of movies and games where high, a touchscreen and WiFi would be a plus, this system is pretty slow.
I guess that Air France has normally a higher standard, but in this case, my ratings cant really be higher.","2016-08-09"
"4","Would have been very good except for strikes","From Bremen to Paris, everything went smoothly. From Paris to Amsterdam, it was a bit stressful being advised via email of a strike then not given updates in ample time. I only knew that my flight to Amsterdam was thankfully not affected by Googling news about the strike.","2016-08-09"
"2","If you book connecting flights it no longer means anything - cost us a fortune","On booking a Hop flight with Air France I had read that they have a policy of assuring punctual flights, which sounded good but I had no idea what bad news this would be to me.
Our flight to the south of France required a connection Paris (Orly.) It arrived at our starting airport Brest 10 mins late and so left with us on it 20 minutes late. By the time we arrived in Paris it was only 15 minutes late. The connection was only 35 minutes in the first place so we hurried off the plane. On entering the terminal from the tarmac I tried the door marked 'Connections' and it was locked shut. So we had to exit with everyone else and then queue to re enter the departures area. We didn't even get to do that on arriving at the entry a scan of our boarding cards informed us that boarding had closed and we had missed the flight. This seemed ludicrous as the flight was only 15 minutes late and we had purchased a connection which used to mean something.
So we had to find the Air France Customer Service Desk who were very nice but could only hurry us immediately onto a flight to Marseille. We were met with a taxi, which was efficient but we were dropped off at Perpignan airport three hours late and the whole airport was shut. So we were left in the middle of a desert with no transport as the car hire desk was of course also shut for the night. We phoned for a taxi to our hotel which was only 15 minutes drive away and it cost 60 euros. 
Firstly I would expect that a flight would wait a short reasonable time for tickets purchased as a connection. Airport tracking should have flagged the fact that we were in the airport terminal.
Secondly, failing this I would expect that the taxi could drop us off in some area of population / civilisation if it's night.","2016-08-09"
"5","first time with air france...great service","Another first, booked on line from NZ and everything went to plan...cheap flight, but had to pay extra for luggage as it was a cabin bag only flight and my wife an I were travelling mainly with Emirates (30 kg limit) no problems though, everything went smoothly..highly recommended..","2016-08-09"
"2","Disjointed flight","Outbound flight via Schipol was fine but the return via Charles de Gaulle was a nightmare. Was advised of a delay at 3.30am which was too late to allow me to change plans so had to turn up at airport and just wait. Information kept changing. Left BKK knowing that I had missed my connection but didn't have any idea about ongoing flight. Was put on a small plane (not Air France) had to pay for every thing even though things on Air France flight was inclusive. Arrived in Manchester several hours late and had to pay for taxi even though I had paid for a train. Would never fly Air France or KLM again, their Unions are too agresive and don't give a hoot for their customers.","2016-08-09"
"4","Nothing extraordinary, but a good airline ","The flight from Paris to Santo Domingo was about 8 hours. My whole experience from this flight was very positive- comfortable seats, enough leg space and good food. The inflight entertainment was also good as I even didn’t sleep (I wanted to watch some movies, quite new ones J). I haven’t had any contacts with the customer service, our luggage arrived safe and on time, so my impression about the airline is very positive. Yes, sometimes their prices are a bit high, but this is very typical for all European airlines.

","2016-08-08"
"5","Comfortable and polite","I always enjoy flying with Air France. Polite and nice crue. I always order vegetarian food and always  served first. There were a lot of movies I could watch by TV. Also there is a bonus points when fly with Air France. Thank you!","2016-08-08"
"3","White Privilege still works here","For economy check-in, there was a single long line. No calling by zones or seat numbers etc. Looks pretty efficient to keep everyone standing in the line for >30 minutes, right? Apart from that, gate attendant in the priority queue kept picking up white passengers from the queue selectively. Some elderly non-white ladies tried to use that queue but were flatly denied. When I confronted her, she flatly lied that everyone going in that line had business tickets. Then why the heck they were standing in the economy line for 10 mins and I have seen some of their tickets. But, my passport was checked in detail on account of that. Any way, the rest of the flight was uneventful. The plane seemed quite new and clean and service was also quite good. The food served was not too bad.","2016-08-08"
"3","Be aware of the 'hand baggage control officers.....' prior to security at Terminal 2F","As I am based for part of the year in Paris and as a frequent traveler I get the opportunity to fly France's national carrier Air France often. My flight last week was on the first day of a week long strike (another one of many) by the cabin staff but I was lucky enough that my flight was not cancelled! I had registered a piece of luggage which weighed 19 kg and proceeded to the security area when I was stopped by the 'Baggage control officers'  who weighted and checked the size of my hand luggage and made me go back to Air France to pay for 3.8 extra kilos..... Air France or Aeroports de Paris learned this from Ryanair- a pity they have not learned from Easyjet  which nowadays allow its clients to take onboard a piece of hand luggage without any weight restriction!....  Why can airlines not learn good practices from their competitors than picking up bad ones? The flight left on time and the on board service was ok for a short flight!","2016-08-05"
"5","Excellent service","We have travelled all over the world and used many different airline companies. On my recent trip to Italy in April 2016 we flew from Montréal to Paris with Air France. This was our third time that we have flown with Air France. This airline company has to be one of the best if not THE best one we have ever used. No other airline company compares to Air France. The planes are always super clean and the leg space is very comfortable. The crew is so courteous and always smiling. The service is absolutely perfect. The food and complementary beers and wines are second to none. Highly Recommended.","2016-08-05"
"4","Classic","As a Platinum member for life of Sky team/Air France, I can only recommend this company.
Although it's not what it used to be,  it's still a most efficient and rather reliable.
Too bad, it suffers too many strikes from the pilots as well as stewards/stewardess...............
But overall it rermain a learder in its field.","2016-08-05"
"1","Rather pathetic","Delayed on ground for over an hour due to 'technical issues' as the staff had to recount the passengers 4 times & when I followed protocol by booking in my 'speciality meal' 2 weeks prior to the flight (non dairy/ egg ingredients - vegan) I was abruptly told by staff that all 'speciality meals' had been given to other people, so I couldn't eat sat on the plane for 14 hours - rather pathetic - will not recommend to anyone","2016-08-05"
"1","Very Poor Customer Service","Having booked the flight and been allocated seats in Business Class my family of 3 it was a surprise to find out that we were put on standby for seat allocation even though I am a Platinum for Life card holder.  We were then advised that my special needs son would be downgraded to Premium Economy because Air France had overbooked the flight.  All very upsetting at the start of a break but was eventually sorted out by the lounge staff at CDG. Is this how Air France rewards those who show loyalty?  Letter written to the President but so far no answer 3 weeks on.","2016-08-05"
"5","No worries","We splurged on business class and the accommodations were worth it. The seating was comfortable and spacious. There was plenty of storage space, especially at the window seat. The on-board entertainment system had plenty of choices. Only the flight map didn't seem to work well.

Both of our flights coming and going had delayed boarding. Everyone lined up on time but for an unexplained reason, they started  boarding 20 to 30 minutes late.","2016-08-05"
"1","Worst flight experience ever","First they delayed the flight for three and a half hours... in half hour bits so we had to stay glued to the queue line waiting for news.  They gave as a complimentary sandwich and drink and eventually cancelled the flight for mechanical failure. It was all ok until then. 
In order to get rescheduled they made 500 passengers pick up their bags, o through customs and queue at the counter for 6 hours (from 12am to 6am in the morning!). Children were sleeping over bags. A girl fainted after waiting for four hours without any food but potato chips. People were exhausted and dozing off.   I ended up staying at the airport for 12 hours overall from the time I checked in to the time I could finally leave. They offered no gesture of goodwill of any sorts except the mandatory hotel stay and taxi voucher which I didn't need for my friends were kind enough to pick me up at the airport and let me stay with them.   Needless to say the flight that I was rescheduled on was delayed for over two hours after we had boarded the plane!   Air France is truly not your best option for transatlantic voyages.","2016-08-05"
"3","A good airline with scheduling issues....","At first glance, Air France is a good airline. I never had too much problems with it. They generally have good seating, services and the food is not that bad. While in the air, my wife and I enjoyed Air France.The cabin staff were good, attentive and plaisant. 

Where things are not that great is getting us in the air. We boarded almost two hours late and we remained on the tarmac for almost two hours and were not even provided water or food. Furthermore, inside the plane it was warm making the whole waiting not comfortable.  And all this wait was because Air France did not have a grown crew to prepare the plane for its fly, i.e., fuel, load luggage, etc. 

As mentioned, Air France is a good airline. It would be a major improvement if they could have better scheduling and more staff for their grown crew.","2016-08-05"
"4","Classy even in Economy","I fly with Air France a lot, partly because I live in France but also because the staff are so unfailingly polite and helpful. There also seems to be a bit more legroom on the long haul flights but I don't carry a tape measure when I fly so I don't have proof of that. Again on long haul the food is pretty good, and I wish I could say the same for the short haul flights, but really, the desultory sandwiches at meal times, and the insultingly pathetic bread sticks they serve in between meals should perhaps be accompanied by giving the passengers the option to buy something a bit more sophisticated...I would certainly be willing to pay a few euros for a more inspiring meal.","2016-08-05"
"5","Air France: Reliable with excellent service and good food","I fly very often, and most often transatlantic.
Depending on who pays, I fly economy, premium economy, business or - too rarely :-)  first.
Here is for the economy.
Air France is not better as compared as other US or EU airlines for leg space in economy. The difference is in the service. Staff is always there and ready to help you.
I never had an issue with this.
The food is good too. And before you get the food, you can have a glass of champagne - which is not provided by any other airline I know (in eco). If you have access to the lounge (depending upon your Flying Blue status), you also have free champagne.

In flight entertainment is good, new and varied.
They don't have wireless.
They tend to be reliable in terms of timing, and if they take off late, they usually manage to catch up.

The 777 AF runs on transatlantic is much better than their oldish airbus. But I understand they are refurbishing them.
A380 is very quiet, the quietest in fact. And if you can get a window seat, you'll be able to stretch your legs on the storage compartment.","2016-08-05"
"5","Always a pleasure","I do a lot of long hauls flights and my airline of choice is Air France. In the beginning this was because I was based in France and it seemed the obvious choice. Flight after flight the airline an crews continue to impress and go out of their way to ensure a pleasant experience. Yes there have been a few minor hiccups but these were handled quickly and professionally.","2016-08-05"
"4","Good service","Service and food were good with no flight delays.  We traveled premium economy which gave us a little extra leg room and helped make the long flight bearable.","2016-08-05"
"4","Good service","The seats were comfortable and I was impressed by the variety of entertainment on board, especially on the newer planes. The staff were courteous and ever smiling. They observed punctuality. Overall a good experience.","2016-08-05"
"3","Not as good as expected","Transfer at Paris, where as we had been told on booking, we had to wait over 4 hours. All arrangements went efficiently to plan. The cabin crew were not as smartly dressed as one would expect on a major airline and the Japanese meal I had in board was awful and this was particularly unfortunate as half the passengers were Japanese","2016-08-05"
"5","Canda","The crew on board was extremely kind and very present for every need. 
The Lounge was very confortable and with everything you can need","2016-08-05"
"3","Average","The check in for the flight to Paris CDG was a little disorganized with lack of proper guidance on which queue to wait in several people jumping queues as a result.  The flight to Paris was late but uneventful.  The cabin was a little dated but the legroom was ok.  The flight attendants were fairly hospitable but the food was mediocre in quality.  The ground staff at Paris CDG was non-existent and we had a harrowing time changing terminals for the onward flight to Amsterdam.  I would avoid flying Air France if possible.","2016-08-04"
"2","Terrible experience","I felt like a trapped caged animal by help way through this 11 hour flight. No leg room, no refreshments, no food other than just after take off and a small pastry not long before landing. Old films.  I wanted to scream, I felt so bad on this flight.
Never, never flying Air France again","2016-08-04"
"5","Getting better (when it works)!","Air France is  clearly improving in quality, in service (friendlier and quality of snacks on short French flights). The only caveat are the strikes which doom this airline. However, if you are a frequent flyer, they take excellent care of you during these difficult times.","2016-08-04"
"5","Good flight. Good service.","This was an Air France operated flight. Arrived a few minutes late which made for a very tight connection. Service was good, airplane in excellent condition, pilot spoke English very well.","2016-08-04"
"5","Airfrance","I enjoy flying airfrance.  The food is great &  the service is outstanding.  The audiovisual could use some improvement, though. Illy espresso is an added bonus to give you the extra boost needed after a transatlantic flight.","2016-08-04"
"4","Professional service","After 7 economy class long-haul flights with Air France I can say they really care well about their guests. The food is excellent and abundant. Staff is mostly very polite and competent. One stewardess even recognised me on my next flight - 6 months later.","2016-08-04"
"2","Basic & Affordable","I have never enjoyed travelling with Air France. Maybe its just unlucky that in the past 5 years I have travelled with them 6 times and something always seems to go wrong, usually it is the luggage which fails to make the connection, even when their is adequate time for it to do so. Charles De Gaule airport is also quite depressing, lacking the amenities that Schipol or Heathrow have.
On this occasion 2 of the toilets were out of order, and the entertainment limited. I was unable to charge my phone as the seats do not have the right connector, despite the fact that their partner airline - KLM does have this facility.
The level and quality of service varies greatly from flight to flight, on this occasion the staff were friendly and always had a smile. On the plus side for Air France, tickets are quite cheap.","2016-08-04"
"5","Usually a Great Way to Fly","We have been totally satisfied with our flights on Air France and appreciated the friendly, courteous attention of their flight attendants on our long flights. In the past we have usually flown Premium Economy but chose to upgrade to Business Class on our way to South Africa. I can never sleep on the overnight flights, but with this upgrade I was actually comfortable enough to catch about five hours sleep and arrive a little more rested.
Unfortunately, our final leg of the trip home, from Paris to Washington D.C. was not so pleasant. There was some kind of strike going on involving cabin crew members which resulted in endless delays. After a total of seven hours in delays though, they finally did get us home, and the very short-staffed crew (providing cod meals) did as well as they could under the circumstances. The ratings below reflect this less than perfect flight.","2016-08-04"
"5","Great flight","Flying to Tahiti from the Baltimore- Washington area was along one we flew first class. Since there are only 2 flights to Tahiti on a regular basis. We arrived at LAX in the the evening, so we could be in Tahiti in the morning to catch our connector flight. When we boarded the Air France flight my wife and I where throughly impressed, the assigned seats where large and comfortable. The food and drink where excellent, they give you pillows, blankets and a travel toiletry kit for your convenience. Service was great and we felt rested when we arrived at our destination. It is worth the money to fly first class on that long of a flight","2016-08-04"
"5","Best Flight Experience Ever","I have been on many different airlines, but Air France is the best.  Firstly, the washrooms are absolutely huge and were cleaned during the flight.  The food was delicious and plenty of it and thirdly, we flew Premium Economy and were treated like royalty.  Every passenger in this section got a small toiletry bag with a toothbrush, toothpaste, and eye mask, sleeping socks and little ear plugs.  The seats were extremely comfortable too.  More so than any other line.  When I need to book a seat for other trips I always look to see if I can get Air France!!!!  The Airline Stewards and Stewardess were extremely friendly too","2016-08-04"
"4","Good flight","Flight was about twenty minutes late leaving Boston, but very good with friendly staff.  Food was just okay..","2016-08-04"
"4","Great Food & On-Board Service","This was the first time I'd flown long haul with Air France and I would have to say that the experience, from booking to disembarking, more than exceeded my expectations.  The call centre operative through whom the ticket was bought was extremely friendly, pleasant and helpful as were the cabin crew on-board.  I have flown business class with a number of airlines and the food quality and presentation on this flight was probably the best business class in-flight catering I have had  Really excellent!  Service throughout the flight was regular and attentive - the crew came round regularly with ice-cream, water, juice etc.

The only negatives were the seats, although comfortable, don't convert to completely flat beds - fine for a day time flight, as this was, but perhaps less so if you really want to sleep and the 'priority' lanes at security at Charles de Gaulle don't really make much difference as the queues were still too long.  My flight was on an A380 (upstairs) and I believe Air France are introducing true flat beds on some other aircraft in the fleet.

All in all a great experience which I will happily repeat.  Being Edinburgh based it is just as easy to fly to Paris as London for a long-haul connection and worth it as the Air France catering and service is streets ahead of the British Airways offering.","2016-08-04"
"1","Never, never, never again","I will Not fly with Air France ever again! It was dreadful.... Where does one begin!! They were over booked and bumping people and splitting families up on to other flights, people were crying and getting angry as they had confirmed tickets. I was told my pocket book was to big and had to be checked and would cost more money!! It was a pocket book so I threw some things away, after which she became belligerent towards me and walked away to pick on someone else. Naturally we were late boarding, about 5 hours, but that happens! The cabin crew were aloof and unpleasant, cabin dirty and cramped, food was poor..... We will not and do not fly Air France!","2016-08-04"
"4","Short flight from Paris to Florence, Italy","After a long and not so great international flight from the United States to Paris, I was not looking forward to this leg of the trip on another Air France flight. 

I have to say - this was a completely different experience and restored a little bit of faith back into this airline. The plane was relatively clean, the seats were a way more comfortable and the staff was super friendly! Everything seemed to work on this plane - the air conditioning, the bathrooms, etc.

We received a snack/lunch on the flight - fresh sandwiches. I have to say this is the top tasting air line food I have ever received. We had a choice between two sandwiches and they were both very fresh, tasty and many around me wanted more. 

All in all, this is a trip that I would highly recommend and when flying to Italy again, I would use this airline for a short flight.","2016-08-04"
"2","Very hot and less than friendly staff made a long flight even longer!","When flying economy or in the cheap seats, I understand that there will be limited room available. I have to say this was my first international flight and my first experience with Air France. YIKES...the seats definitely were some of the smaller ones I have experienced and there was not much leg room to be found. Okay...it is economy so I understood and was willing to suck it up.

Air must have been extra and certainly was not a luxury given to the economy section. I was flying with a larger group (19 of us in all) and we were seated in various locations throughout economy. At first when I felt no air out of my vent, I thought, okay this might just be me....nope our entire row. Then as I started moving around and talking to everyone else - air was definitely an issue. Around hour four of the flight - it became almost unbearable. Literally sweat was dripping off us and when we inquired there was a curt explanation about them not being able to do anything about it.

We were not expecting to receive dinner, so that was a surprise. In my history of airplane food, this I would say ranked at the bottom, but then again, it was so hot on the plane, that any type of food probably was not going to be good.

There were a few different times that others around me had questions or inquiries for the staff - they were curt and to the point, not much customer service was given, but then again, they were probably just as hot and irritated as we all were.","2016-08-04"
"4","Pretty good","Flew to Paris in December 2015 for a short break. Nothing to complain, staff spoke good English, overall a pleasant experience.","2016-08-04"
"4","nice for short flight","Trying this airlines for short flight when i got special price from travel agents, its cheap (i got promotion price), spacious enough for me and partner, clean, the snack was really bad, we dont like it, and the stewards not really nice to us.
The one i love about this airlines was the unique and informative video about safety flight (how to use the safety belt etc)","2016-08-04"
"4","Air France - Good Flights, Nice Prices but Terrible Connection Times!","Air France connects to most of the major hubs in central Europe (AMS, ORL or CDG), which is not bad; but sometimes their connection times are very extensive (even more than 12 hours) if you are traveling to America. Prices are quite competitive (if not the best... if measured by distance/cost), their meals are great (but sometimes too much fromage du fromage!!) and service is great. Recommended for all travelers.","2016-08-04"
"4","A good choice for my trip","I traveled round trip from Paris to Nice. 
It was safe, on time flight, so enough for me. That time I had to connect the flight from Paris Charles De Gaulle airport to Hanoi, Vietnam so I really appreciated this flight from Nice to Paris arrived on time.","2016-08-04"
"1","air farce one","a group of drunken russians delayed the plane by arriving late as they were obviously engaged in the important art of getting drunk. Whilst on the plane they were obnoxious, loud and irritating...despite this, they were given as much free alcohol as they requested...standing in the aisles drinking wine by the bottle....so sophisticated!   when i contacted the air line they really could not have given a damn....what ever you do...do not use this company.......i was under the impression that drunken louts were not to be allowed to board","2016-08-04"
"5","Efficient and Friendly!","From check in to landing, this was a positive experience. The staff were helpful, friendly and very efficient. Look forward to my next flight.","2016-08-04"
"4","Good flight and good service","Our first time with Air France but service was good. Again with such a short flight the aircraft is your standard A320 with same seats at front I.e get row 1 or no extra legroom. We were impressed with in flight service","2016-08-04"
"3","The cabin crew went on strike compromising our return trip home","We had planned to return to SA by leaving Paris on Monday 1 August as it was imperative we were back in Port Elizabeth by the 2nd - however the cabin crew went on strike and we were advised to amend our flight details to guarantee a trip home so we cut short our holiday by a day used the extra money saved on accommodation to upgrade to premium seats to ensure a spot on the plane as they were travelling with reduced cabin attendants so the economy passengers were bumped. This did not make me happy.","2016-08-04"
"4","Comfort and sympathy","Very good space for legs, good food and good variety of entertainment with several recent films. Good landing. Helpful and kindly staff.","2016-08-04"
"4","Good service","a short flight, the plane was half empty, plane was spacious, i was suprised that the staff offered us food for such a short flight","2016-08-04"

They are often on strike but this didn't affect me recently.

The flight attendants are very helpful.","2016-08-03"
"4","Amazing service on board","We had a flight from JFK to Paris where we had to change aircrafts and Paris to Mumbai in June 2016. The flight was almost full but the service of the airhostesses was  spot on. They never failed on a customer request, always served and came with a smile and did small talks with a lot of passengers on board. I was very impressed with Air France and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to try it out","2016-08-03"
"5","Another great flight","I traveled Manchester to Tunis, with short  connection in Paris. If you book a few months in advance the prices are very good, and include 23kg luggage, meal and drinks. You can even change your seats 24 hours before you fly for no extra cost!
The staff are always friendly and helpful.  And so far all my flights have departed on time. 
My only negative is that the last time I flew to Paris, the plane taxied for more than 10 minutes from the terminal, so we had to get on the bus which had to take us to the terminal ! - might be a problem with the 45 minute connection they offer..... I'll find out in September !

","2016-08-03"
"1","When i didnt think Air France could get any worse","Just when I thought Air France couldn't get any worse on their service from Paris to Mumbai. Then on the 10th July I took the AF218 to Mumbai.
Firstly someone had been sick before getting off in the middle row opposite my seat and it had not been cleaned properly so when the people sitting there complained the Air Crew had to try and clean it up but you could smell it. They then moved the people  only to put blankets on the floor and get other people to sit there!!
The plane is so old that my seat was broken and each time I sat back the seat reclined no matter if I wanted to or not.
With 1.5 hours of the flight to go I asked for a red wine. The Air Hostess went away and came back to tell me they had run out. Yeah right ok.
I am a Platinum Card holder with Air France with over 250 in the past 2 years and that's how they treat loyalty.
The best is they leave you nowhere to air your views other than Social Media. I don't have a twitter or facebook account. I have however left comments on Google + but no answer.
Air France its no wonder the company is in the state its in. You need to wake up and think about the Customer.
Just for reference the Customers are those people who sit on your planes. the people who ultimately pay your wages and the whole reason that you are in Business. This is a point I think that you are missing.
Living where I do in France I don't have a choice so have to use Air France although I have changed my next flight back to Mumbai to use Jet (code share with Air France) as I am just fed up with old planes and poor customer service","2016-08-03"
"5","A pleasant transatlantic flight","From start to finish this flight was a pleasure. Check-in went very smoothly. The flight attendants were welcoming and attentive. The evening meal and breakfast were very good for airline food. The flight was uncrowded; I had two seats to myself and slept well. It was one of the most pleasant flights to Europe--comfortable seats, decent food and wine, and I slept most of the way. What more could you want?","2016-08-03"
"1","Extremely disorganised and stressful way to fly . . .","What a complete shambles that greeted us at the check in - I don't know if there was a problem with staffing numbers or if this was usual but because there were only a few booths open, the line kept growing and then as it got closer to each flight's departure time a staff member would hold up a sign with the time on it and everyone on that flight broke the line, ran to the desks and tried to get processed in time to board.
To add to the agony, one passenger had a problem with his booking - which was on his phone - and instead of just one staff tied up trying to help him, they kept asking other staff to come over to discuss the problem!
We were just thankful that we arrived early (thought we'd have time for a leisurely breakfast before the fight - ha ha) and eventually got on the plane in time.","2016-08-03"
"4","My sister and I flew from Nice, France, back home to San Francisco","Our flight left on time and arrived on time.  Our flight attendant, Pascale, was charming and attentive.  Her friendly personality, patience and grace contributed to our satisfaction with Air France.  Our luggage was NOT lost.","2016-08-03"
"5","Fabulous! ","  Flt. crew up front was very professional.  Was worried about the length of the flight from Los Angeles to Tahiti  until I was awakened by the bright lights turned on to serve breakfast. 
  What happened?  
  We were served champagne the night before during boarding. Chose our travel accessory bag .  After take off a wonderful meal service including lobster appetizer with a heavenly sauce  and a beef medallion entrée with a lovely Bordeaux and cheeses . So much to remember by dessert. 
  I was wearing my AF socks and slippers, under a very warm blanket with my seat fully horizontal when I went into a full comatose nap all night before I could even put on the sleep mask. I thought I didn't sleep on planes. 
  When the lights came on, breakfast was being served. The attendants do set your table with linen and silverware before serving you two very good meals.
  Immediately afterwards, passed out custom forms and touched down in beautiful Tahiti. 
  Our only disappointment was when AF deplaned a completely full flight leaving the Business Class door the last to be opened. We stood in line for customs for two and a half hours with no air conditioning. 
  The returning flt from Tahiti to Los Angeles was just as nice as going over. Flt crew was friendly and professional. Also slept again after my meal.

Luggage arrived and was ready on the belt in a short time","2016-08-03"
"3","Check-In at CDG is a Fiasco!","The ""automated"" check in procedures at CDG are a total fiasco! 

There are very long lines, taking up to two hours to reach the machines, which then invariably do not work correctly.

Once checked in, another equally long line to drop off baggage.

This is NOT progress, it is just making life worse for all travellers!!!!","2016-08-03"
"1","Horrible flights","Flew home from Europe via Air France.  HORRIBLE!!!  Somehow they had our reservations, could print off luggage tags, but not boarding passes.  We first flew Berlin-Paris.  When we got to Berlin, it took an hour to get our boarding passes.  Then in Paris, it took them another hour to retrieve all our info.  They had our reservations in the computer, but had given our seats away.  They finally got us on the plane, but none of us were seated together.  Just to add a further frustration to our trip, my tv screen wouldn't work.  They tried to fix the problem twice, then gave up.  We arrive at JFK to catch our flight home.  Again, no seats available.  Finally, they get us on the plane.  Again, not together.  I will NEVER fly Air France.  They just don't care about you.","2016-08-03"
"3","Missing luggage took 2 days to arrive from Amsterdam to Paris","Legroom and cabin space was adequate. Food and beverages were rather good.  However, our luggages did not turn up upon arrive at Charles de Gaulle.  We filed missing baggage at the kiosk which was an efficient way - quick and straight forward. The assistant said that there was another flight from Amsterdam arriving at 10pm. So I asked if they deliver on Sundays, in which she replied 'yes' with a wink! 
Anyhow, all day Sunday we tracked our baggage online and no change in status was made - ""luggage located"" and at airport.  Anyhow, our suitcases eventually arrived on Monday afternoon.   
My point is they should have a standard delivery timing and let passengers know, even if they don't deliver on Sundays.  At least we don't have to waste our time checking online, calling the call centre (which was useless - communication problem and they have no more info to give out to us but the girl was gracious and helpful) and could have prepared to go out and buy the necessities.  
They also said that they will reimburse us for the expense but no progress yet.","2016-08-03"
"4","Good airline but premium economy is blah","I traveled from Shanghai to Paris on the Air France A380 in Premium Economy. The airline is reliable and has good aircraft and amenities.

However, for the extra money one pays for an upgrade to premium economy, the seats do not justify the price. The food is meh and service, while good is not what you get from the Gulf carriers.

Overall, a good flight since most of it is overnight but an expensive premium eco","2016-08-03"

Great service with smiles
Great meals

"5","In LOVE with Air France!","THE BEST airline I've EVER flown on.  Premium Economy was nothing short of amazing in every area - comfort, food, entertainment and service, so many wonderful and considerate details that made our transatlantic flight a delightful, first class experience.  Separate boarding ramps for the top floor and lower floor seats (it was a double decker) made for very effcient boarding.  Smooth flight, communications from pilot were in French and English and the crew were friendly, professional and multilingual.  Premium economy on Air France is far better than first class on some other airlines.  We definitely will book Air France again.","2016-08-03"

"4","Amsterdam (Paris) to Miami on Air France","For some reason we got upgraded to something near-business class..... and we were not complaining. From Paris on we had a VERY comfortable flight, great on-board entertaining and wonderful catering.
Walking to the rear the folks down there (where we should have been too) seemed to enjoy the flight much less. We'll see what happens on our homebound flight, with Air Europe this time......
Flights were on time, although we hate waiting for transfer (this time in Paris), just sitting around and waiting at an airport gate. The time I had multiple lounge passes is long gone, alas.
Immigration at Miami is a DISASTER of course, so if you can avoid it, enter the US somewhere else !!!","2016-08-03"
"4","Elegant service","We enjoyed our trip with Airfrance. The service and level of cabin care was impressive. my only criticism is that they ran our of scrambled eggs in the morning and given the Business class cabin was only half full this is a poor oversight.","2016-08-03"
"4","A much better way to fly from Birmingham","As my son works in Rio we have often travelled there to visit him. Being able to fly from Birmingham to Rio via Paris makes it a much more pleasant and economic route for us to get there. We only need a local taxi service to get us to and from the airport. Much cheaper than 4 weeks car parking charges or expensive and inconvenient travel to Heathrow. I have checked the prices and discovered that the part of our journey to and from Paris to make our connecting flight is provided virtually free of charge. There are no internal flights from Birmingham to Heathrow!

Timings of travel are very good and service of airline staff has been excellent and so is the food. Proper bread is served with the meals rather than the usual cotton wool found on most airlines. As we have made several visits during the last five years we have been able to use our flying blue miles to gain entry to the Air France lounge when we have a long wait for connecting flights and also upgrade our flights to business class. On some occasions we have also used the KLM Flights via Amsterdam in the same way when those flight timings have been more convenient but they do not provide the option of Premium Economy seats.","2016-08-03"
"4","GOOD SERVICES !","Longtime ago, I did not want to take AF for long haut since 2008. But this time, i am back because AF had good offer to China in business class.

"3","Angle Flat Business Class","Air France has many qualities, but their old business class seats just don't do it for me. They are angle flat, not full flat bed seats.  The person inside cannot get out without disturbing the passenger by the corridor.  The TV screen are tiny and not touch sensitive.  Nice service, but spoilt by an outdated product","2016-08-03"
"3","Pleasantly surprised","I was very skeptical about flying after reading some of the reviews here, but we had a good experience overall.  The airline was relatively new looking  and clean. The food and service were on par with most international flights we have taken. The seats were fairly comfortable with the typical legroom, Our pilot let us know when we were flying over the Alps so people could enjoy the beauty below us. The pilot sincerely apologized for being 15 minutes late at arrival. I would fly this airline again.","2016-08-03"
"3","Dusappointment","Flew Into Mexico City around 11 and air France doesn't check you in till about 4 and there is no access to the lounge until you have checked in. Check in went smoothly and the lounge was unexceptional but okay.  Flight was three hours late so dinner was not served till almost midnight and then, finally, when I could sleep for this ten hour flight, the bed, advertised as flat, was not completely flat.  I should have had a three hour Layover before my flight to Tel Aviv but I barely made the connection but was impressed that my suitcase did. The flight to tel aviv had seven passengers In business class but only economy class seats.  Free wine and a curtain was the concession to business. On the return flight they changed the time ofthe flight but never informed me making me take a very expensive rush hour cab.  Sat in the lounge for hours.  The Clarins spa was closed and I had trouble connecting to wifi and no body really cared.  The flight back was uneventful but business and first class luggage was the last to be deplaned and I waited an hour.  Not impressed at all.  They sent me €600 as compensation.","2016-08-03"
"2","Inconsistant very poor service","The seating was fine for business class with fully reclining seats.  I don't generally care about service or food but was surprised that it was just ok. We were full price ticket holders and I felt like we could have been the poor cousin who just happened to get upgraded for free.  The staff was not very attentive and even seemed put out when a request was made. Ok get up and serve yourself in the galley buffet?  Could have worked out if the staff would have stopped taking their break or gossiping session about the passengers in front of the food and never move out of the way. They seemed annoyed that I stood waiting for them to move so that I could serve myself. No offer to serve me instead and I just kept getting dirty looks that finally made me give up and go back to my seat hungry...ask for water....or more wine...  During food service, No no, annoyed again.  yes when you pay this much for an airline ticket I do expect service with it. Not to mention leaving one piece of luggage behind and instead of notifying me just waited until I came to them with a missing luggage claim. Oh yes we know.... It didn't make the plane. You'd think the three people at luggage just standing behind a desk could have announced my name and let me know instead of letting me spend an hour looking for my luggage to come out on the belt.   Flew them because it was non stop but our flight left three hours late. Yes that was announced the day before but it really threw my first day of vacation into a tail spin of juggling activities and reservations. So much for good planning","2016-08-03"

However the return flight from Paris back to Dulles did not meet my expectations. Albeit, friendly the crew did not provide the exceptional service I experienced traveling to France and the food was not great, especially the second meal. It was mostly sweets. The  crew vanished for four hours, thus no water for hydration.  On another note, there were numerous  options for entertainment such as games, movies and music.  I watched four movies coming home.","2016-08-03"

"5","Plane felt slightly dated, but otherwise good.","Flew Air France to Saint Martin on an Airbus A340. Booked seats in advance with our backs against the central cabin divider, so were slightly worried about not being able to recline our seats fully, but luckily they were ok and had plenty of room. 

The plane itself felt a little out-dated, and the in-flight entertainment systems were not exactly modern - you had to lean forward and squint to see the screens, unlike Emirates and Etihad which have nice big, clear systems. Still the flight itself was fine. Plane was smooth, leg room was plentiful, service was good, staff friendly, and on-board facilities were fine. 

With St Martin being a French/Dutch island, airline choices to fly there are obviously limited, but I would fly there with Air France again.","2016-08-03"
"5","Same prices as American carriers with a feel of France as soon as you step on board","I travel worldwide and Air France tops any American carrier flying to Europe. Their planes are newer, meals are still free, as is champagne in economy. One checked 50 pound bag is free as well. Air France's service is excellent and their flight attendants are very kind and helpful...yes, even in economy. Delta is Air France's partner but there is a world of difference in the quality of experience. I never have any problems with this company.. From the moment you step on board, you feel like you are already in France. The food is excellent with two choices of hot meals, wine, champagne, and liqueurs are all free, and the meals are plentiful with quality products and you have a starter, main course, bread, cheese, dessert...all you need.","2016-08-03"
"4","Thankful for families first!","We were flying out of Africa to the States.  During our layover in Paris the flight was delayed.  Not a big deal to us because we had plenty of time for our next connection.  However, we were each given a $5 dollar voucher for food at the CDG airport (total of $25).  I thought this was very considerate.  Also, as the flight was boarding everyone lined up, a very long line!  I asked if we could board in the first group since we were flying with a toddler and they moved us right through.  I know AF has its ups and downs with strikes and what not, but on this occasion we were very satisfied with the airport service.  On the flight the food was very good and entertainment selections were adequate.  I will say that AF and Delta do not have as many options on transatlantic flights as I have seen on other airlines.  But, no complaints.  Plus they were very accommodating of us and our family on the long flights.","2016-08-03"

"3","Good luck with your Bags !!","I have flown Air France several times now.
The flights themselves are fine....but....
Should your bag miss a connecting Air France flight ....GOOD LUCK WITH THAT !!!
Not only is their computer system about 30 years behind the times...they can't tell you when your bag might show up...but their attitude on top of that is totally lax...extremely frustrating. The ground personal will tell you they are trying to find out all they can, which at times, is next to nothing...or maybe...who knows...but their actual baggage handling in moving your bag to your ultimate destination is nothing short of a complete joke !!! They have to be one of the worst in the industry. And trust me...I have flown around the world several times....many international flights.","2016-08-03"
"1","Horrible Service","While in Europe for pleasure and business my wife had the unfortunate experience of a perforated appendix and emergency surgery in the Czech Republic.  After assuring there would be wheelchairs available for both our flight from Vienna via Austria Air and at Charles de Gualle in Paris via Air France we attempted to make our way home one week after the surgery with medical approval.  No problems in Vienna where the wheelchair was available and the service was perfect.  We confirmed again that the wheelchair would be available in Paris.  Needless to say that did not happen and we had zero cooperation from the airline and the airport to remedy this.   We were told that a wheelchair would take more than an hour to procure and that we would miss our flight to the U.S.  Airport and airline employees were rude and unconcerned. I had to put my wife on a baggage cart in order to get to our connecting gate on time.  We have flown to and from Europe numerous times and always see horror stories related the Air France and the airport in general when arriving In Paris or connecting.  We will avoid both in the future.","2016-08-03"

"4","Reasonable food returns to the air","Everything about the flight exceeded my expectations. The Airbus 380-800 provided enough leg room in economy class for me.
Prior to dinner they poured Champagne.  
Dinner was the best airplane food I have eaten in years.
After dinner you were served coffee and brandy.
All this in economy class. 
The Airbus 380-800 is a heavy pane and the weight seemed to smooth out most of the bumps you can experience during air turbulence.
All in all, the best flight I have taken in thirty years.","2016-08-03"
"5","USA 2016: LA to Edinburgh","Air France brought my wife and 4 children home from a superb family holiday in California. The cabin crew were first class, very attentive, great meals and snacks etc. The movies, music and documentaries all helped speed the time past. 
No complaints, and I highly recommend flying Air France. Merci.","2016-08-03"
"3","Long Haul","Air France check-in was very efficient in Santiago. Considering we travelled economy class our leg room was adequate, although I have short legs!  The cabin crew were very pleasant and the food adequate. In economy class you only have 2 choices of main courses. The entertainment was comprehensive, latest films, music channels, tv programmes etc.  You could get up at any time & walk to the kitchen area & get a drink or something to eat.","2016-08-03"
"4","Business as usual","Air France flies the Paris - Wuhan Route 3 days a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) and this is truly ideal.  The Paris leg is 12 hours or so and the CDG terminal is easy to manage and to navigate in. Do make sure that gate is the correct one as you may not have a long time to change terminals. Most terminals are close enough to walk over but you may not have time to exchange money. The flight itself has good points- the food is great, the inflight entertainment can be very boring. The staff are always friendly.","2016-08-03"
"5","A Return To A More Elegant Way To Fly","The cabin was clean and inviting, the crew was very friendly and eager to serve, the food and snacks were delicious, which included complementary wine. In short, in was like flying back in the day when flying was considered a luxury- no cattle car operation on this air line and on time flights to boost. Air France has my vote on intercontinental service anytime.","2016-08-03"

"4","Very pleasant and comfortable flight","We took a trip to Paris, France my wife and I in late April 2016 and returned back to Cairo Egypt the first day of May. The trip was pleasant. Chairs were comfortable and the meal was quite good and filling. The inflight entertainment screens showed several new and good movies, but there were some lagging issues and not all programs worked. The flight attendents were prompt and polite. Would definitly use it again to go back for another visit. By the way the onboard duty free shop has several nice things to buy if you're interested.","2016-08-03"
"5","Watched an amazing crew deal with emergency on a packed midsummer flight.","It is easy to criticize airlines  and flights today with restricted legroom, often bad food, and crammed planes.   However, I was so impressed on my last flight (Paris-Boston) with the performance of the flight crew when a medical emergency occurred that it seemed I should reconsider my judgment.   A  fellow passenger seated just in front of me suddenly was having a seizure. The senior crew, in the midst of serving dinner, stopped everything and rushed to get the man out of his seat and onto cushions on the floor.  They did everything to communicate (in a variety of languages), called for medical assistance from any doctor on the plane, and found his partner located in another cabin.  Fortunately, there were some 4 doctors on the plane who all came to help and the partner was able to give advice about hypoglycemia.  Finally, the ill man was revived and his partner was moved up to sit beside him for the rest of the trip.   The crew could not have been more attentive, helpful, concerned or professional.   I realized that was the most important part of what they did and were trained for, and everything else was  pretty insignificant in comparison.  I congratulated the two senior staff, but it was hardly adequate.  Otherwise, the flight was uneventful and fine.","2016-08-03"
"4","Great entertainment, good food, but please do not be lenient to smokers!","Booking and boarding was easy. Got offered a wide range of entertainment, finally got to see some of the movies I wanted to catch for a while. Seats were fine. 
Twice in a row, my luggage got damaged, never had suitcases tear and twist but on two Air France flights. What really bothered me on my last flight was that my neighbor from behind was caught smoking in the bathroom and got of with a warning and a promise to not do it again. Anyone endangering a flight in any way needs to get punished severely.","2016-08-03"
"5","10 Hour Direct Flight from LAX to CDG Paris","The best and quickest way to Paris.  We've flown Premium Economy as well and the food was excellent in both classes. It is the quickest way from California to Europe and is a great hub to go anywhere to other destinations as well - we have used it as a jump off to Moscow, St Petersburg, Istanbul and Athens. If you want to explore beautiful France, you can fly into Paris (CDG), lease a car for the month and drive to Normandy (Stopping at Monet Gardens on the way) then cruise on down to the Loire Valley for Castle viewing then on to Beaune, France for more wine tastings, and continue on down stopping at various interesting towns ending in Nice. From there you can fly back on Air France as part of a round trip they provide, where flying back to LAX from Nice has the same pricing as flying back from CDG.","2016-08-03"

Sometimes they tend to be to much French, but it is ok.","2016-08-03"
"2","Worst flight of my life","It was my first flight with this company and we were excited because of the positive comments about the service.
We take this flight from Punta Cana to Madrid with stop in Paris. Service from PC to Paris was good; when we arrived, the flight to Madrid was delayed. Had to wait 3 hours! After 3 hours, When we checked in the information screen, flight was Canceled. Zero information about the reasons! There was not ONE of Airfrance crew that call all the passengers of the flight to explain...Of course we went to the air france counter to check if the information was true. First, CREW DOES NOT WANT TO SPEAK ENGLISH, i had to beg asking for someone to speak english. Second i ask for this guy to pay attention what i was asking and accidentally i touched him in his left arm. He talked to me like if i was killing him and honestly i wanted to tell him all kind of things but he was the only one that ""could speak english"". It was  hard to me to keep silence , even people in the line told me not to...but we wanted to get to Madrid. After all the discussions, there was this woman part of airfrance crew that walked us to this counter so we could get help. Unfortunately, we had to sleep in Paris. They gave us 8euros each to eat something in the airport, and this hotel near the airport, the bedroom was so small that i cant explain...finally, next day we could get to Madrid. 
I hope this comment get to the airfrance customer support...first at all, your crew have to speak english. They dont like to, but they have to because of their jobs. Second, you need to train your people how to treat customers in a middle of a crisis! I felt like this guy that work for you didnt know to control himself. third, how do you cancel a flight and even your crew cant explain the reasons? And fourth, when things like this happens, you dont have to wait the customers go and ask what is going on, you have to call all the passengers, explain the situation, APOLOGIZE and then offer them (us) a solution.  For the first time i flight with air france and dont want to repeat EVER.
I was forgetting telling you that we lose 1 hotel night prepaid in Madrid and we rented a car, one day less of our schedule. It was a dissaster!!!!!","2016-08-03"

The flights from Paris to Houston and back were totally different. Excellent service comfortable jet, nice food and pleasant flight attendants. 
Why should it be like that???","2016-08-03"

"4","Premium service, but poor aircraft for local flights","Air France is all about premium style flying. It's more expensive, but you get more in the package. Like a nicer terminal: boarding in Lille is through the tubes, and in Marseille you get the best terminal (T4), with most amenities and comfort.
But with the flights between MRS and LIL, I wouldn't fly if didn't have to. The Embraer aircraft are uncomfortable at best. The seats are average, but the in-flight heating is terrible. Either it's too warm or too cold. I've flown a few times last year and really cannot recommend those aircraft.

Tips for reserving: the closer your inbound and outbound flights are together, the higher the price. Use the flexible date options wisely, to save a lot of money.
And they really don't have last minute deals, they'll even sell the seats on an almost empty airplane at very high rates the day of departure. Best change is to book a return flight with return flight a few months ahead.

The airport services are really good though, there are many kiosks (in MRS) to print your tickets, book flights, check flight info, ...","2016-08-03"

No complaints and will certainly use AF again.","2016-08-03"
"5","Above and beyond","You have a choice when you fly, and most of the time the fares are pretty much the same.  So how do you choose?  Quality of service.  Air Canada needs to take a page from how Air France conducts themselves.  From check in to gate, they were helpful in getting our infant everything we needed.  The in flight service was excellent, and the staff went out of there way to accommodate us.  The food was incredible and the baggage came out quickly.","2016-08-03"
"4","Rarely a disappointing experience.","A chance upgrade this time around with Air France made this an even more comfortable and super pleasant experience , although it's always nice to travel Air France.

I'm not a big airline food junkie but it seems like every time I fly with Air France they add the little ""je ne sais quoi"" to make their food more edible.   Even for airline food their food prep is impeccable and yes, tasty.
I always look forward to flights on Air France.","2016-08-03"
"3","Nice service onboard on part of trip but variable quality of flights","I booked return flights from Southampton to Kiev via Amsterdam outbound, and via Paris Charles de Gaulle inbound.  The flight from Kiev to Paris was fine, comfy enough but the leg from Paris to Southampton was not as good.   I had not realised that the plane from Paris would be a lot smaller (a Dash 8) with less room for cabine luggage than the flight from Kiev.  Air France have a partnership with Flybe who provided the last leg of the return trip.  This was not very clear in my documents.  Food onboard the Air France flight from Kiev to Paris was free and of good quality, but I had to pay to buy food on the Flybe flight from Paris as it is a budget airline.  Considering the high price of all my flights altogether, I totally feel I should  not have paid for any food at all and Air France should provide free vouchers for the Flybe portion as they are partners.  Hence just  score of 3.","2016-08-03"
"5","Great flight","Organised, efficient and friendly. Some other airlines need to spend some time with them and learn that its not just about cheap fares.  The process from boarding to when we disembarked was relaxed and pleasant.","2016-08-03"
"5","Simply love this airline","I make this flight pretty regularly for business and pleasure.  The staff is always professional, terrific food choices, great wine selection.  The planes are spotless and I have rarely encountered problems.  Does it cost a little more?  Sometimes.  But it is worth it.","2016-08-03"
"5","About perfect!","We used expiring points to fly business class from San Francisco to Paris in May.  Everything was first rate.  From the moment we entered the International terminal at SFO to our arrival.  The check-in experience was fast and easy.  We were provided complimentary access to their Club after we cleared security where we ate and drank well in quiet comfort.  Our plane (one of those giant new Airbuses) was the best plane I've been on.  Quiet, comfortable, large bathrooms plus an area up front where you can just hangout and stretch.  The return home was equally well executed.","2016-08-03"
"2","Beware they weigh your personal item!","AF weighed all my bags including carry one. Has to buy 2 check in bags which we were prepared to do. At security they weighed our personal item and said it was overweight so they would not let me thru. Sent me back to AF which made me pay for an additional bag (and my check ins were not even at max weight) at 70 euros. They would not bend even though they knew I paid for two bags earlier and they were not at max eight.
Terrible customer service","2016-08-03"
"3","High def TV with lousy food","Flying Air France I was expect certain things and I was surprised both in good as well bad ways. The good: fantastic tv screen with a great portfolio of music, tv shows and movies with really good resolution. The bad: the food, probably the worst I had in a long time! Also the checkin in CDG was confusing and lousy. The neutral: crew were nice and overall cleanliness was good. Flight on time and the seat space was small as expected.","2016-08-03"
"5","Comfortable","Comfortable flight. The flight attendants were courteous and friendly. The onboard snack on the short flight was extremely good.","2016-08-03"
"3","No preparation on a known delay","Our flight from Madagascar was delayed by a medical emergency.  It was an 11 hour flight and a lot of passengers were in transit.  When we got to the transit desk there were three desks being manned. It was ridiculous. People eventually got rather vocal about the lack of staff and after half an hour more staff arrived and the member of the ground staff who dealt with us was excellent.  Why did it take them so long ? It was an Air France flight so Air France ground staff should have been prepared.","2016-08-03"
"3","The last of the strike...... One more made by stupid staff with no consideration for their clients","Well, well, well, terrible flight, delayed of course (I booked many flights the same day to be sure to fly as I had a connection), then  in A'dam again flight was delayed. In short a trip end to end of 7 hours ++ for a bit more than 500 miles??? 
What else can I say, the service was very  poor, no explanation of delay until we were on board, at NORWICH airport traffic jam at the customs (we stayed on the run way queuing to go through the police control ( 2 planes arrived at the same time????). Unbelievable, NORWICH is the only airport where you pay airport taxes on the top of you ticket and the services are the worse in Europe?..
There is an error somewhere??","2016-08-03"
"3","Let down","Had flown with air France many years ago and was impressed so was looking forward to this flight
I was very disappointed 
Food was not that good
Stewards never smiled and weren't very helpful
Would think twice before booking again ","2016-08-03"
"1","Worst airline in the skies","I was harassed by the staff too many times to count.  they ended up giving us a cheese basket delivered to our home and 2 free tickets because they knew that the attitudes of the staff were so outrageous that any court in the world would have found them guilty of horrible uncalled for harassment.  I am an white American, 55 years old and always dressed properly and a great attitude and politeness always a number 1 goal when traveling by air,  at one point when I was told...""if there is a problem on the plane, I know you would be on our side because I can tell you are a tough guy""
, I stood in amazement and was completely silent.  10 minutes later when the head of the plane stopped by my seat and told me ""you have had a bad trip today"" I said, ""everything was great thank you for inquiring"" and turned my head down.

I could write a book, but take me at my word,  this airline needs help and training for it staff.

Delta told me if I ever get bumped from another flight I cannot be made to fly Air France.  I will keep them at their word....forever!","2016-08-03"
"3","Correct service but need to increase its service","It was not so much time approximately 6 hours flight. It is not flat seat. I was not able to sleep like when I travel n Emirates","2016-08-03"
"4","Premium Economy Not So Comfortable","AMEX Travel services recommended Premium Economy in lieu of Business class, that was a mistake. Delta's version was better, but it may depend on the aircraft design. Had opportunity to upgrade while checking, sorry I  passed it up.","2016-08-03"
"5","Perfect flight","Good food, friendly people, great drinks, good communication, on time (not so common in Africa). Also very fast handling of lugage in Charles De Gaules!","2016-08-03"
"2","on the decline","I take Air France all the time, because my company has a deal with them. The Frequent Flyer Program motivates me to use their services also for my leisure flights. although an honest review of the benefits reveals that all I get is access to the Sky Priority Line - the program is worthless if most of your flights are in coach class, which has become the standard for business flights within europe, even for big companies (mine is very big). 
There are basically two problems with Air France. First, they had to reduce headcount for in flight personnel, obliging them to reduce service to a minimum (what costs is not the meal, but the service). Their east-european partner airlines offer far better service. The real problem is that one is never sure if there's going to be a meal or not. The other day I brought a salad because I was uncertain if they would serve just peanuts as they do quite often, and when I asked the flight attendent to put my salad dish in the trash bin she frowned upon me. Great! 
The other problem are the frequent strikes. I experiences three strikes in the last 9 months, and frankly, it stinks. It adds stress to an already stressful experience.
I wish I would not rely on Air France. Whenever I can I choose KLM, they are much more reliable, the personnel is more friendly, and their Amsterdam Crown Lounge is fabulous. 
The sorry thing is, Air France was really classy 20 years ago. What a waste.","2016-08-03"
"4","Nice, comfortable flight","We were returning from France after two weeks, so our party of 4 was tired. The check-in at CDG was quick and painless. Can't say the same for the walk to the gate. It was the longest walk in an airport - ever. The passport control was slow and under staffed.
On the other hand at the gate the boarding was quick even for a full 777. Onboard staff were excellent. Food was far above average for economy. Legroom was ample and in-flight entertainment was good. The flight operated on time and was a super smooth flight. I would rate this flight as excellent.","2016-08-03"
"2","1 flight over 4 with strike or lost suitcase","The company is not reliable. They lost my suitcase several times, suitcas broken too several times. Strikes either n the company or in CDG.","2016-08-03"
"2","Adequate just!","Although this was a short flight, it rates as one of the more average flights I have taken. The boarding process was a schmoozle. We were bussed from Terminal 2F to an apron near Terminal 2B. Boarding was a shambles  and the flight left over 30 minutes late. The ""snack"" was a hard bread roll with some sort of filling. I would prefer nothing to something inedible. Budget airline service and food at a regular airline fare :(","2016-08-03"
"3","Air bus is a great vehicle; too bad Air France is not an equally great airline","We were oh so lucky that the plane was not full and had the opportunity to move to an empty row of 4 seats for the two of us.  Too bad that the arms for the seats were fixed so you could not spread out.  The food was virtually inedible.  The crew was in hiding. The flight did leave and arrive on time","2016-08-03"
"4","Excellent in most aspects","Excellent service, flight attendants always ready to help.
Very good meal served, one of my favorites.
New planes for this long route with individual entertainment systems. Of course, many french movies.
Something I don´t like, at all, is that I had no option to choose my seat, just for upgrade, I got terrible seats on both ways. It is terrible for someone who likes to walk have a center or window seat for long flights, specially when someone by your side sleeps all flight.","2016-07-29"
"1","Terrible","I am so upset with Air France. Our family was supposed to go from Nice to Paris and then Paris to Athens. A few days before our flight Air France went on strike and we were not even notified (a friend told us).  We were scared that our flight would get cancelled or get moved and Air France couldn't really tell us anything until the day before our departure.  We were two families traveling together, the other family got an email but our family never got an email. So if we weren't traveling with them we would have arrived at the airport to find our flight canceled and never made it to Greece to catch our cruise.  Thankfully we were able to catch that before and booked flights on a different airline.  I am very upset with Air France and every time I fly with them something goes wrong. I would never ever recommend this airline to anyone.","2016-07-29"
"2","Cancelled our flight","Well first of all when we arrived in Paris our next flight was with air France that was supposed to take us to Montpellier and when we checked in 3 hours before and they told us that we might not make out flight. We were so frustrated because you are allowed to check in 24 hours before the flight but we couldn't because we were flying from Chicago. So we had to wait until 5 minutes til boarding. They said there is a 50% chance that you can get on this flight. But the thing is what got me so mad is that we booked this flight 6 months ago. Anyways 3 min after everyone boarded the lady at the plane deal told us that there are 7 seats left in the plane. A family of 3 came in the remaining 2 minutes. So there were only 4 seats left which is the suze of our family. Thankfully we got the seats but it got us worried sick! The people treated us like nothing. I would never recommend this airline to anyone.","2016-07-29"
"5","crisp and cold sandwiches!","it was a good experience, it was a short and crisp flight, no fuss, served cold and crisp sandwiches!","2016-07-28"
"1","Awful - ruined my summer vacation","We flew into France for Euro 2016. We were informed a day before we landed in the country that our flight from Paris to Marseille was cancelled. We had a day to sort out alternative transport to get us down to Marsille. After much scrambling we managed to get a mini van for the 9 hour drive to Marseille. Terrible. I did manage to get my money refunded though. I'll never get the time bacvk though","2016-07-28"
"5","Hassle free flight. Attentive staff. Good food","Have flown with AF five times to SA. We fly Birmingham to Charles de Gaulle France an hour or two stop over then of to South Africa. Air and ground staff are helpful and pleasant .","2016-07-28"
"3","Difficult","Air France makes it difficult. You cannot get seats before the flight. Also one-way tickets are way more than round-trip tickets, also leading to inconvenience and unnecessary expense. Although they claim to be partner with Delta, they do not recognize Delta Skymiles or sky priority seating. 
Flight itself was normal.","2016-07-28"
"1","Air France is ""pants""","A cabin crew strike resulted in my flight being cancelled . The flight they rebooked me on was delayed but two hours. The desk assistant in the lounge just give me a ""Gallic shrug"" and I paid for this....and I am Platinum Flying Blue Member - so much for loyalty - I will consider going back to BA...mmm better still bring on the Middle East airlines","2016-07-28"
"5","Good experience flying with Air France, better than last time.","We were unsure to use Air France again as some years previous we missed our connecting flight to Orlando. This time all went well seats, food and TV choice were all good. Nice reclining chairs in terminal building too while waiting for connecting flights you can lie down.","2016-07-28"
"1","Flying blue uncomfortably","Flying blue on premium economy seats that are near the galley with lights shining on me all night and unable to sleep a wink. Most terrible seats. Legroom is just as bad. Technical issues delay the flight two hours. Lands even later, reaches three hours late. Thanks air France for showing me how not to fly.","2016-07-28"
"3","Good Food, Good Service","I really like the services and food they are offering. Although I will not prefer Air France always, because you feel more turbulence in Air France compared to other airlines with whom I have flied. So those who have fear of such things be aware of this and food lovers like me, fly with Air France. :p","2016-07-28"
"1","Disappointed","Through no fault of Air France, our flight was delayed three hours on the runway due to weather. The problem was taking over two hours to distribute water with a surly attitude. The air was not circulated and the attendants obviously unhappy. We would have loved  a smile at any time. Even after take-off and during food service, the attendants silently frowned. 
I was very excited to fly Air France and even took French lessons prior to the trip. Of all the airlines we have flown yearly in the last nine years, this was the worst attitude of staff.","2016-07-28"
"1","Don't argue, just sue them!","Had several problems with this mess that calls itself airlines, they lost my bag, left 4 hours late, crew constantly on strikes or walk away... horrendous service, planes old and smelly, food inedible, after I returned to my country had to sue them to get my money back and compensation, will never ever fly them again, even if I have to walk.","2016-07-28"
"5","Great Service","This was our first time flying Air France.  We wanted to experience it, as we love France and the French People.  The service was very good, and premium economy was great.  Lots of room, great food, etc.  The ONLY bad thing was the seat.  It was not comfortable and I realize the idea behind it was good, but the pod seating is just not comfortable.  The leg rest hits you too high, and doesn't support your legs at all.  I would fly again.  On our return flight we were upgraded to business.  Wonderful seating, of course, and meals.  Service was beyond believe for me, as I have never flown that level before.","2016-07-28"
"1","Customer Service at it's worst","Flight attendants treat you like scam. I took this flight twice in less than one year and I surely will never repeat the same mistake ever again.
Service is poor, tickets' price are high so not sure why one should fly Air France","2016-07-28"
"4","Good flight","There are is improvement after the last time that I travel with this airline . I think the management are actually trying to make sure that everybody involved in the services provided to all service users are the best. Keep the good work going. I will surely recommend Air France  because I can see that the attitude of some staff are changing for better now but there is still work to do with the French speaking staff. Few of them don't respond well to you if you speak English to them . Please can we have a training around this attitude. Above all I love Air france ","2016-07-27"
"5","Still a treat on a trans atlantic flight","Air France is a sky team partner with Delta Airlines. They serve a better meal than Delta on the flight to Atlanta. The aircraft was a Boeing 777, modern and clean. There was fine state of the art on board entertainment. The wine served with the meal in economy was complimentary and still in an individual bottle. You can also get a cognac to enjoy with your coffee at no extra charge in economy! Flight was on time, luggage arrived safely as well.","2016-07-27"
"2","Never paid back as promised","Beware last time Air France was on strike there was a big deal, or a big marketing campaign and they promised to reimbourse our hotel and meals because of the strike that we had to pay for. It wasn't much about 250 euros.
I followed the procedure, sent the original bills and despite my efforts we have never been paid back.
Don't believe them if they promise to pay for your inconvenience.","2016-07-27"
"4","Good as always","I like flying with Air France, and this time everything went in a right way - the food, service and good weather during the flight.Also , to see handsome cabin crew members and even more handsome pilots was an added bonus.","2016-07-27"
"4","No seat choice until last minute","I wast not able to  select a seat until last minute at YUL. I know it can be done as my daughter had an assigned seat on this flight several days before. 

Makes me reconsider flying with Air France if I cannot get more service than cheap Air Canada.","2016-07-27"
"5","Great flying experience","One of the best flights ever. Superb service, legroom, flat bed, staff are excellent at check-in and on board. Food of an extremely high quality. Overall, a joy to fly.","2016-07-16"
"5","Excellent A380 service to Europe","For years I fly Lufthansa's A380 service from San Francisco to Frankfurt and to Budapest.  This year I tried the Air France A380 flight to Paris and transfer to Budapest.  I must say that Air France beats Lufthansa...  

The AF ticket was significantly cheaper than the Lufthansa in the same time period.  The food and overall service was superior to LH.  I realize that Air France runs the A380 on this route only in the high tourist season; I also suspect they try to poach LH customers and that is why they try very hard.   In my case, they were successful!","2016-07-16"
"5",".....The royal treatment on air France'.....","... In 2015 ........We again flew to Paris on Air France.  We have been flying on this wonderful airline for the last 20 plus years!  Now that I am ancient I need a wheelchair and this airline ALWAYS makes sure that I am greeted at the curb and than whisked to wherever I need to be. They come and get my from the Air France lounge so that I will be boarded first!  The in flight crew are always very polite and there in nothng they will not do for you to make your trip fabulous! The food, wines and comfort are fabulous!   I am met at CDG at the  airplane with a wheelchair and whisked once again thru customs and straight to baggage.  Then, taken down to the car rental area.  I cannot recommend this Airline enough!  Bon voyage... Judi Dunn, Tallahassee, Fl.","2016-07-15"
"2","Air France ancient equipment","An old Airbus 340 whose electric controlled seats malfunctioned often enough that the cabin attendant knew just how to unjam them.  They don't go flat as modern ones do. Avoid this equipment","2016-07-15"
"5","Air France by far has been one of the best","Air France by far has been one of the best, if not the best airline we have ever traveled.  We boarded the first flight at LAX.  Upon entry, we could tell by the décor that we were going to have a comfortable flight.  Comfortable seats and a very friendly staff. The first flight was from LAX to Parris France, then we flew to Barcelona Spain.  On the first flight, we were fed twice, and it was complimentary.  The flight attendants passed out a menu for us to review prior to making a selection.  In addition to the menu, they gave us a package that had sleep mask (to cover your eyes) and a headset.  The movie and TV selection was up to date and had a wide variety of choices.  The second flight from Parris to Barcelona was a little over two hours, but that didn’t stop the crew for feeding us on that flight either.  The next time we travel to Europe, I will defiantly fly Air France again.","2016-07-14"
"3","It was ok.","It was ok. The plan needs to be updated. The baggage allowance is 50lbs and carry on's are 20lbs. This was ok. However, you do have to pay 25usd if you purchase online or else its 50 at terminal.","2016-07-14"
"5","First rate","First rate experience. New plane with very comfortable seats. Very pleasant and attentive crew. Excellent meal. We arrived in NYC refreshed and in a good mood.","2016-07-14"
"3","Business class not as plush as Asian airlines","To begin with the lounge at Delhi airport was a disappointment. The bar poorly stocked — no bourbon or malt, limited collection of Indian wines. And the food was full of carbs and very mediocre. The aircraft was old, the screen was small, controls and user interface very dated, no privacy screen between passengers. Perhaps after the plush business class on Emirates A380 and B777s this was a let down. The meals served on the Delhi-Paris route was very poor. The fish supposedly Perch tasted like Basa which is unpalatable. The omelet for breakfast was inedible.
On the way back the experience was much better. The lounge in Paris was large and airy and the food was very good. While the aircraft was the same the food was much better. All the meals were good so obviously the problem is the catering at the Delhi end.","2016-07-13"
"1","The most uncomfortable seats we have EVER had!","The Premium Economy seats (B773) are rock-hard. The seats do not recline much. Rather, they slide downwards. My wife and I booked 23A and the adjacent seat as it was an exit-row seat and Air France and SeatGuru did not say there was no window.  There was no window.
We endured these incredibly uncomfortable seats for 12 hours each way. If we wanted to be uncomfortable, we would have booked Economy (Coach). 

Further, the food was inedible. Fat and gristle in my beef dish and cold pasta in my wife's. We didn't eat it - there was no alternative.

We complained about the uncomfortable seats the to the flight attendant in the jump-seat at the bulkhead in front of us. His response was that he got the same complaint a lot. Don't waste your money.","2016-07-13"

"1","One of the worst airlines in world","I haven't flown Air France in a few years, but thought would give them another try. I booked full fare Business from LHR to CDG to BOD for well over $1200. The first leg, was just economy 3 seat config with centre seat empty. That, was tolerable, although not business class. But the CDG to BOD, it WAS economy (3 seats each side, all full), just they gave a better food tray. I have flown close to 2900 flights in my life. No more will ever be Air France.","2016-07-13"
"4","Nice staff and good service","Chose this as an alternative option as opposed to the flagship airline. We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the service, and the staff on board.

Previously the idea of flying a European Airline had filled me with dread, but after the first flight we took with Air France, the idea of going with them again was welcomed. The staff on board were very friendly and helpful and the food was also very good.

Their prices in comparison to the flagship airline were much more economical (1/3rd less) and even though there was a stopover in Paris, we arrived at the same time as friends who flew the other airline direct. In addition Paris airport has good restaurants to rest in during the transit period.

Will certainly be flying Air France again as it allows us to stretch our travel budget further.","2016-07-13"
"5","One of my best flights from France","If you have the chance to take Air France from Europe to China, you should definitely take the opportunity.  Pluses of the trip include:

1.  Food was wonderful
2.  Service on board from the staff top rate and pleasant
3.  Quiet cabin and modern planes.  Economy comfort seats were definitely a lovely addition for a long haul flight
4.  Speedy checkin and deplaning at Beijing.","2016-07-12"
"1","Delayed Flight Fiasco","A regular scheduled flight from Manchester to Paris with a perceived major international airline should be plain sailing....unless you book with Air France.
The flight was rescheduled 3 times during the day due to plane requiring 2 replacement tyres. Being an Airbus A320 you would assume plenty would be available at a busy airport like Manchester, but no Air France only keep 1 on-site? We had to wait for another wheel to be flown from Paris on the next available flight. Why could they not buy one from another carrier??
Anyway, the flight eventually took off 8 hours late and half the original passengers. We had missed a connecting flight to Nice to Air France paid for overnight accommodation and meal at a budget hotel at the Airport. We had no baggage has this had been mislaid in the fiasco.
Eventually we arrived, somewhat disheveled at our destination.
Upon return to the UK we had received an email from Air France apologising for events and offered us either a credit against future flights (you must be kidding) or a lesser amount for cash refund (yes please).
Firstly the email advised to contact the Air France Refunds Department and that 'i would find the telephone number on the web-site'. If you are Sherlock Holmes maybe..anyway I eventually found a page which advised to the number to call and press option 5 then option 5 to speak with someone. Guess what, there is no first option 5 only up to 4 options which none of refer to refunds!! 
I decided to press option 4 then option 5 and a lady transferred me to the department. Once I gave all the details they requested I was told it will take up to 28 days to process?? really what they mean is, ""WE ARE KEEPING THIUS MONEY FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE AND WE DONT GIVE A JOY ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE"" I wonder what they would say if when I booked my flights I had said the same to them. AVOID, DO NOTY FLY WITH THESE MUPPETS, only 1 spare wheel/tyre for an A320!!
Thankfully my return flights were with KLM, what a difference....","2016-07-12"
"1","Liars and Thieves!!!","Dear Air France,
   You have ruined my vacation. You are liars and thieves, and you have made it impossible to get help for my pregnant wife's and my lost luggage.
   On July 7, We flew from Paris to Athens on flight AF1532. then from Athens to Paphos on Ryanair. When we got to Paphos, our luggage was not there. It was in Paphos that we learned, for the first time, that Ryanair does not do baggage transfers, and we were supposed to have picked up our luggage in Athens and recheck it!  Again, this was the FIRST time we heard this procedure because when we checked-in in Paris, the Air France employees forced us to check our bags, and told us it would go all the way to Paphos!  
   For some reason, the check-in machine in Paris was not letting us print baggage tags through to Paphos, so we had to have a human Air France  employee print them for us. I now know that the machine was smarter than the human because your Air France employee should have known that Ryanair would not have done a baggage transfer in Athens. Furthermore, The Air France employee should NOT have printed a baggage tag that went through to Paphos!  She should have sent the bags to Athens and informed us that we would have to pick them up there before transferring to our Ryanair flight!
   I was skeptical of the whole process so I asked 3 different air France employees if our bags were Really going all the way to Paphos. All of them said we did not need to worry, we will see our bags in Paphos. This was a LIE. 
   When we got to Paphos, we were made fools of by the Swissport operator because we did the wrong thing when we didn't get our luggage in Athens. Apparently we were not supposed to trust 3 different Air France employees who all told us the same thing!
   To me, the solution was simple:  Ryanair and air France just needed to play nice together for 3 minutes and place our bags on the next flight from Athens to Paphos. Done. 
   But no. Instead Air France redirected our bags from Athens to Barcelona to London and finally to Paphos using their partner airlines Agean and British Airways. So we would be without our clothes for 48 hours instead of 24. 
   However, when British Airways phoned the Swissport in Paphos to tell them that our bags were on the flight, we were excited to finally go back to the airport and pick up our bags. But they were not there!  They were nowhere to be found!  They looked up the luggage numbers and found no records. 
   Air France, you are thieves.  It has been 5 days and we still don't have our luggage. It is somewhere in Europe. 
   We have tried calling, emailing, Facebook messaging.  We've called Athens, Paphos, London, Paris and even Delta in America just to get SOME help!  Our travel agent, relatives in France and London, even the receptionist at our hotel in Paphos have spent hours on the phone trying to find our luggage. I want answers!  If it is lost, TELL me!!!  And reimburse me.
   Everyone keeps telling us that our bags are in Paphos.  They are not. We have been lied to and stolen from. 
   Because of all the airlines involved in multiple countries, Air France won't even let me file a lost luggage claim with them. They keep asking what my claim file number is, but that is what I am trying to GET from them. 
   Air France, you have been dishonest, sly, and flat out MEAN.  You are a disgusting company.

"5","To from states to Europe","Awesome, I'll never fly any other airline for international travel unless there is no option.  They were AWESOME!  Treated us like royalty and there was plenty of space...such a rarity on an airplane!~","2016-07-11"
"4","Fantastic but no food","The A380 is starting to look old inside.

The caterers were on strike so cold food was offered which was only marked in French and we had no idea what it was and tasted bad.

Aside from this the flight was great.","2016-07-11"
"4","Very Good","We were returning to Istanbul from Los Angeles with a layover in Paris. The plane was a a380 it was new and modern. The in-flight entertainment system was easy to use. The food was not bad. The service quality, check in and boarding was good. BUT they lost one of our luggage. We had 6 pieces of luggage they lost one but they sent it to our house 24 hours later.","2016-07-11"
"5","Customer Service Beyond Expectation","I rarely use a travel agent, and a mishap with our ticket from Paris to Madrid confirmed my desires to take care of things myself. Then again, the credit for saving our vacation goes to the very kind agents at the check in for Air France. Unable to use the check-in kiosk to get my boarding pass, I solicited the help of an agent helping those unfamiliar with the self-check computers. I was quite panicked when I learned that the reason I was having issues was because my ticket was for 10 days later! Despite the request to book a ticket on a given day (and hotel rooms that matched the intended day of travel between Paris and Madrid), the ticket I held was for a date after my scheduled return home from Madrid! The agent walked me over to another agent at the ""help desk"" and both proceeded to work on a solution, one checking the computer, while the other phoned a supervisor. The good news was that there were available seats on the flight. The bad news was that the costs for changing our non-refundable ticket added up to nearly $2000! I quickly began thinking about options (renting a car would be a hassle with two countries for pick-up and return, the train strike was in full effect, making that a less desirable option). Fortunately, the agents did not give up hope. Eventually, we missed the flight we had gotten up early to make, but were given seats on a flight only 2 hours later than our original plan. And the cost was reduced to $400 by purchasing  a refundable ticket for a later date and then moving that one to travel on our desired day--a strategy I would never had considered. And, the agent even gave us a complementary upgrade to economy-plus. Considering that this was our error, I was really taken by the kindness and compassion of these agents. While the addition of $400 forced us to be more frugal with our dining options for our remaining nights in Madrid, it could have been much, much worse! And yet another example of how wonderful I have been treated by the French--I do hope that Americans quit spreading stories about how horribly they are treated!","2016-06-13"
"5","Superb service at a good price","Flew from Paris to Johannesburg in May 2016. I was initially anxious to book with AirFrance having never flew with them before, but I was more than pleased with the service I received. Service on board was fab (complimentary champagne and all!), no delays (we were in fact ahead of schedule), and super speedy baggage collection. 

The only thing I would say is the food on board was questionable - strange fruit purée with breakfast was rather bizarre. 

But other than the strange fruit purée - a wonderful, warm experience has with AirFrance. 

I'm using their service again in June to the Netherlands they were that good.","2016-06-12"
"4","Delightful across the Atlantic","Air France treats you well in business class.  There is the standard excellent menu and an insert of the day's chef special.  Note that the seats are NOT completely lie flat on Airbus A3xx aircraft.","2016-06-11"
"4","Biz Class Great - except back row by galley","Its a long flight and you are well served with sumptuous food in business class.  However, this tired A330 had tiny video screens that really need to be replaced.  And note, try not to sit last row right side when the galley is in the middle.  The banging and slamming of the carts goes on the entire flight and they shake the seat.","2016-06-11"
"5","Very impressed","Very pleased.  The check in process at Manchester was fine although there was quite a long queue.  Staff were friendly and efficient on the ground.  The service on the plane was great (although only a short flight), the cabin crew were very polite and professional.  The return leg was the same.  CDG airport is very nice and the self check in process worked well.","2016-06-11"
"1","Awful","This was the worst flight ever!  We have had the reservations since August 2015 (in which they had our money). We get to the airport at 3 am only to find they have cancelled our flight and we would be leaving at 10:15. At 11:15 we finally leave.  As in another review we were to be seated together, at least with our spouses, not so. Some got lucky to have people trade seats others were not so lucky. After a 9 hour flight next to a lady that smelled like a perfume factory of which I had a major headache we arrived home. She was French and got anything she wanted.  Service by the French flight attendants were great if you were French, if you were American not so.  I couldn't so much as get a glass of water after asking a couple of times. Movie selections were poor also. I will definitely try to avoid this airline at all costs. We flew KLM on the way over and it was great.","2016-06-10"
"3","Business flight between Hamburg (HAM) and Paris (CDG)","Flight operated by A318, mark: F-GUGJ, flight time: 1h35min

Overall, an european standard business class product; layout 3-3 with middle seat blocked.

The new eats on Air France A320 series are just a pain....there is no possibility to recline at all the eats, including in business class....to avoid for flight longer than 2 hours.

Breakfast just average; some salami, ham and cheese, orange juice and water.","2016-06-10"
"3","Delays...","This airline is chronically late. Used them to fly from Toronto to Tel Aviv, Israel, connecting through Paris.
Seats are tight. Food is reasonably tasty, delays are unacceptable. For a reason beyond me, they do not allow pre-selecting seats outbound from Paris. Very unacceptable. Their prices are on the lower side but you get no surprises either....","2016-06-09"
"3","Economy Premium class on Air France","We will avoid Air France in the future. The seats in Premium Economy were the most uncomfortable seats we have experienced for an overnight flight. True they were wider than standard economy, but the shape of the seat is terrible for your back. We ended up stuffing the pillows and blankets behind our lower backs to make unbearable. The seats do not recline, but shift position slightly in an odd way. There are footrests that come up at a forty five degree angle that leave your lower legs and feet dangling. As this was an overnight flight , we paid extra so that might sleep....no way!  Air France executives should give these seats a try to see for themselves how badly they are designed. Food for a French airline was surprisingly poor. Might as well fly economy and save the extra money we paid.","2016-06-08"
"5","The Way Flying Used to Be","We chose the first row of 2 seats, row 50, on the 777-300.  Not only did we not have to deal with a third person, the row in front of us was 3 seats, and we had the extra space from the aisle seat of row 49.  So we put our under the seat things there, and we had lots of foot room under the seats directly in front of us.  We were served 2 meals.  The primary meal had a menu with 2 entree choices.  We received a wet towel beforehand, and we ha a glass of champagne!  Our meal was delicious and ample.  Service with a smile was gracious and  unhurried.  After the meal, there was a service cart with ice, glasses and various beverages left at the rear of the plane.  So if you wanted a glass of water, you didn't have to wait for someone to appear.  You could get it yourself right away.  The setback video screens had hundreds of viewing choices.  TV programs, movies, games, well you get the idea.  Check in went well.  For anyone unfamiliar with CDG, allow plenty of time because this place is big, and it gets busy.  Can have lots of traffic to slow you down, or a long walk to get to your terminal.  We always allow 4 hours (but we are seniors and especially cautious).  Everyone was helpful.  We had checked in on-line, and that expedited everything at the terminal.  I love shopping at CDG, so if you ar like me, build in a couple hours.  Arrival in ATL was the usual mess.  We are Known Travellers with Global on-line passes, so we are able to skip the monster lines for customs and immigration.  But what you can't skip is the TSA line for rechecking to a connecting flight.  Fortunately, we were only about 30  people back, but it took 30 minutes to get to the conveyor belt.  This situation has to be improved.  So make sure you have allowed plenty of time for your connection.  You will arrive at terminal T, and we had to go to terminal B.  It took us over an hour to clear TSA, get a train and get to our gate.  Too much walking to get to connecting gate.  Can't wait to fly them transatlantic again.  Just fantastic!","2016-06-08"
"3","Convenient way to get to France from Vancouver","The best thing about this flight was the skypriority that came with a premium economy ticket. We virtually breezed thru security, boarding and luggage claim because of the skypriority status. The seat though was not that comfortable especially one can not recline but slide forward.!! Service was average, food was typical airline food. Being a direct flight, I will fly the AF to France again","2016-06-07"
"2","Never fly with Air France to African francophone countries where they enjoy a position of monopoly","Let's start with the price: I had paid 2,600 Euros for an economy seat from Paris to Malabo.

Food: little food was offered for an over 6-hour flight. No choice at all.

Service: well well well....you see, you have the feeling that whenever you ask for something you are being made a favor.","2016-06-07"
"4","Decent service, good on-line services","On-line check in is very simple. The company sends reminders and check-in messages in advance. In-flight service is standard, even food (sandwich) is served. Minor delays (up to 15 min) occur.","2016-06-07"
"2","Business Class was a disappointment","Its been quite some time since I last flew Air France, but I can remember that it was nothing special then.  This time I opted to pay for an upgrade for the business class to experience it.  I must say out of al the Sky Team Airlines, I had higher expectation for Air France, but was terribly disappointed. The seat configuration (2-3-2), comfort, experience and overall customer service was poor. As we stepped onto the plane, the flight crew didn't greet us, they were in the galley having a conversation amongst themselves. No pre flight drinks offered, and those seated around me with coats had to ask the flight crew to hang their coats and jackets. The meal service seemed rushed and trays were just handed to you and not set on your table. At least with Delta, meals were individual heated and prepared and delivered individually, giving a more personal service. The service carts, needed to be replaced wheels were locking and cant be controlled by the attendants, it hit the side of my seat and seat across form that the lady seating there would brace herself each time the cart passed. The worst part, flight attendants didn't even apologize for it. The lavatory was the only thing left an impression, having a window inside the lavatory was unique. Both seatmates next to me commented that the entire trip the one good, or rather interesting memory of the flight, the bathroom has a window.  If these are the lasting memory from premium frequent fliers, Air France may need to make a lot of changes.","2016-06-06"
"1","extremely poor services","Extremely poor services by Air France ground agents. They are no help for travelers to check in as if they do't care if you miss the fly.","2016-06-06"
"2","Air France Domestic Business class will feed you soy beans for lunch! Bummer!","I am concerned about the flight attendant's sloppy and poor quality service at Air France and HOP by Air France. Flight attendants served us meals without wet towels. Our hands were dirty and we did not wash our hands. They treated us like gypsy. The flight attendant in business class was impolite blatant and lacked respect. She did not give us to relax and sleep well because she created business class environment to be distraught and stressful. She all times stomped her high heel shoes all times from front to end and back loudly. Her unpleasant noisy walk us bad impression about her. She is not artsy and blatant. Why did AF hired that flight attendant to serve business class passengers?  I got a soy bean salad on a flight from CDG to Oslo that SOY BEAN salad is undesirable and toxic for men health. Also, Hop Air France offered only white plain bread. I asked a flight attendant for optional breads or crackers but there were no options. I asked for optional meal instead of soy bean salad. There were no optional meals. Rumors are spreading that AF will feed peas or corn for business class passengers soon like I got soy beans. I was thristy one hour later and pressed a help button. Nobody did not show up in business class. I had to search for a flight attendant around the cabin and chased for a flight attendant in order to get a drink. What service! Negligence and attitude at business class! The business class seat cushion and business class cabin design/style are not great and they look not comfortable and distraught and old tired style. We realized that we need to spend our money on British Airways business class or SAS business class because AF business class product is outdated, exhausted and distraught. There is no entertainment system in business class on all AF domestic flights. Seat cushion is sucking! Do not spend your money on business trips with domestic Air France and HOP by Air France. They are worthless!","2016-06-06"
"1","Very dosappointed","I travel constantly and I have to say the first class cabin, compared to other airlines, is really disappointing. On a 777 plane, the seats were no different from a business class seat. The meal service was disappointing, and the once, well-appointed amenity kits were lackluster. I would definitely choose another airline for transcontinental travel where the seats are more comfortable and spacious, especially given the price point. Air France step it up!","2016-06-06"
"3","Strange timing for refreshments","This was the return leg from Havana to Paris. Outward leg was fine, in a new Boeing 777. Return was in an older version of the same plane, and it was lacking in a USB port and the ability to use your own headphones and get both sound channels.
But the strangest thing was the timings for food.
It was an evening flight, leaving at 22:55, so we were not really prepared for the full meal at about midnight (not sure when it came), a snack would have been better and then lights out to sleep. Found it not easy to sleep after eating, but the lights still went down!
Food was good though.Breakfast was OK, not long before landing. 
Otherwise no problem, except for transfers at CDG which can be quite a trek.","2016-06-05"
"1","Lack of food and service","7 hours gap between meals is completely unacceptable. If travelling long haul with Air France, be sure to take a packed lunch or a meal deal. But must admit that the short haul to Manchester was up to standard. Long haul seems to have a problem.
This was not a one off experience, we had the same lack of service on our outward flight to Bangkok.","2016-06-05"
"1","Arrogant Air France Staff","Our bus from Nelspruit was delayed and we arrived at the Air France Check in Desk 3 minutes before the flight closed. We waited for the couple in front to remove their baggage from the weigh in scales and put our baggage on. We were thern told to go to the ticket office across the hall from the desk. We waited for the guy at the ticket office to finish dealing with a customer and explained our presence. He sent us back to the check in. The check in staff told us the gate was closed and we were too late. They would not accept our pleas and our explanations. They would not accept that we were not actually late and that their own instructions had prevented us from checking in on time. All to no avail and eventually it cost us £500 to fly Air Egypt via Cairo. Subsequent letters to Air France have lead to a refund of £48 each and after much correspondence 300 air miles each.
No apologies, no understanding, no sympathy and we are Frequent Flyers on Air France's programme. Disgusting treatment from very arrogant and disinterested staff at Johannesburg.
We have a house in South Africa and fly at least twice a year to the UK. Additionally we  have friends and family visiting every trip. Our loyalties have now been transferred to Turkish Airlines so Adieu Air France , we, our friends and families have voted with our feet.","2016-06-04"
"5","A little more money but a whole lot more for your money","Did not pay more for extra leg room and we were treated like business class. Amazing seats and the food was superior. We haven't had food like that for many years on an airplane. I loved this flight.","2016-05-05"
"3","amazing, lucky start, rude end.","i was flying back to London after my holidays in paradise, everything on my way there was as it suppose to be, nice food, nice service, 5 stars overall on my way to Venezuela, i can't complain about it.

My problem was on my way back to London. I did my check in at the airport (i had to pay an extra luggage) and by luck i got a shuffle upgrade to first class, very lucky and happy i felt in that moment. 

As soon i went to the plain everything was getting above expectation as first class should be, the crew in general very helpful as soon i got into the plain, after like 20 minutes one of the crew or maybe the captain, i don't really know who was the guy came to me explain my seat was book by someone else and i asked how is that possible if i got the ticket in my hand indicating the seat and everything like it should be, then another guy who also i don't know who was but it was part of the crew as well was very rude and asked me to stand from the seat because that wasn't mine, he took my boarding pass (the one indicating first class seat) everyone there was looking at the situation because the guy wasn't discrete, he made a kind of show making me feel like it was my fault and i did something wrong when it wasn't mine, the he start to speak french with the rest of the crew when we were speaking in English and the rest of the crew close to him started to laugh i might say at me because the were looking at me, i felt really bad and then they relocated me to another seat not even saying sorry or helping me to take my stuff to the new seat, nothing, really bad from Airfrance, for sure i won't recommend the airline to some one else, really bad manners from them and of course no costumer services.","2016-05-05"
"4","Madrid to Paris","This was a short haul between Madrid and Paris and it was very pleasant. They offered free refreshments and peanuts free of charge. Legroom was very good for a coach flight and the crew was ver pleasant.","2016-05-04"
"4","Premium Economy worth every penny","I've done 4 trips with Air France now and chose Premium Economy --well worth the extra few dollars involved. Plenty of leg and seat room, plenty of room in the overhead for bags. Premium customers get Sky Priority seating, we're off and on quickly, we get a little package of goodies consisting of socks, eye shades, ear plugs, toothbrush and toothpaste, covers for the headphones. The meal was very palatable for airline food and the wine and other drinks are complimentary. Also, the WC is used by only a few people so, no line ups and it stays clean throughout the flight.

In addition, the tray table is large as is the TV screen and there are a good selection of movies and TV shows to choose from.

Sleeping is still an issue even though there are foot rests and a bit of a panel for the legs, so I think if you have the cash it's well worth it to do business class for overnight flights.

Air travel is never fun, but Air France is okay. They stick to schedules, the flights are fairly comfortable, the amenities are good, plenty of water to stay hydrated, the food is edible (as long as you don't choose a special meal --we chose vegetarian for one flight and it was so ridiculous it seemed like a punishment for not going with the regular meal..we got fruit salad and apple sauce when there was a perfectly good pasta meal on the regular menu).

Oh, and I love the security video..tres droll.","2016-05-04"
"5","Brilliant crew","We had a pleasant journey with them to Bogota.

The crew was extremely nice, they were serving us tons of drinks as it was super hot on the way there.
Not sure why was it so hot on the plane, but they make up for it.

Entertainment was good, no hiccups, everything was working fine.

I left my ipad behind when leaving, but they were very helpful with finding it on the end.","2016-05-04"
"5","Excellent food and service","Excellent choice of food and wine. Attentive service. The only down side is the angled flat seats in A380 fleet, very difficult to fall asleep. I am more used to 1-2-1 configuration where you get more personal space and privacy. I wish AF will refit C class seats on A380 and change it to Emirates A380 C class configuration.","2016-05-03"
"1","Don’t fly Air France – it is just not worth it!","Unfriendly stewards who are unwilling to listen or help, a bloody cold flight (15 degrees in the cabin), frozen sandwiches and barely 2 meals which were just not sufficient for a 12.5 hour flight with extremely small seats and no leg room to spare or any modern equipment to charge your devices, the flight was just really disappointing.

Once arrived in Paris, for my connecting flight to Hamburg, I decided to make use of the available 3 hours and get a sandwich, not knowing that 2F would offer such sandwiches and when asking airport staff they claimed not to speak English, of course that raises the question why work at an international airport? But perhaps that’s just me. 

So I went outside, and then upon return they start to complain about the weight of my  hand luggage. In Bangkok this was no problem but now it all over sudden it had become one; what’s worse after having been send to 4 different locations, I finally arrived at the right station where they thought it was fair to charge me for the entire flight, not just the continued flight to Hamburg for so called overweight luggage; my total weight was within the agreed terms and conditions! Almost 100 euro and having to go again to a different location to make the payment this was really where I felt they just lost a potential future customer. Most expensive sandwich in my life. But wait it gets better…, actually no, instead of things getting better the security was horrible, no friendliness whatsoever and just plainly disrespectful.

The flight to Hamburg was no fun either, just rubbish even the lovely elderly German couple next to me were treated rudely, so luckily not just me. Now, I normally don’t like to complain like this, but considering it is the second time in a short while that I had a negative experience in France, and especially as the entire Air France trip was the most horrible I have ever had, and I have flown at least 200 times, I felt it was worth writing a review to warn future customers. As such, I would recommend you to chose another airline and avoid Air France under any circumstances, it’s as I said just not worth it.","2016-05-03"
"4","Quite surprised","I had a two leg trip back and forth to Dulles.  First way all economy, second way I did business for half, economy for the 2nd leg.    With United, and Delta no longer receiving subsidies via ""Fly America""....you have to fly from Dubai thru Charles de Galle, Holland, or Frankfurt.   In the past I've hated to fly through Paris because of the crappy way the French keep their airport.   One terminal is new, with actually bathrooms you don't have to wait for.   I digress.  Planes were new, clean, food was very good.  Soooooo much better than Delta and United.   United was the WORST!  There is a more limited selection of online movies in English, but there are plenty of choices for most people.    Business class food was wonderful.  Economy class had smaller portions (which I appreciated), tasty mains, and sides were very french/european.   Nice cheeses, good bread, excellent services from the staff.   Bathrooms were cleaned regularly, as opposed to the mess that accumulates on Delta and United.   I'm impressed with Air France, excellent flights!  Very surprised.","2016-05-02"
"4","Wonderful service from flights to AND from Atlanta to Paris!","I took a business trip to and from Paris on Air France and was completely delighted.  The flight attendants were friendly, helpful, timely, considerate, and a sheer pleasure.  I was practicing my french and they assisted with this as well as attending to all manners of needs to include my attempt to use the headphones for the entertainment system.  My only complaints were unrelated to Air France:  turbulence made the flight bumpy on the way out and the seat did not go completely flat.  On the surface, this comment sounds haughty but if the seat does not go completely flat then it is useless beyond a simple reclined position that any airplane seat could do.  The problem is that when it is not completely flat, you still ""slide"" down the seat and it is NOT comfortable.  I couldn't sleep a wink on the overnight flight.  The entertainment system was great and the screen HUGE!  The food was excellent with excellent dishes AND preparation.  I would fly Air France again.  The outlet worked with any plug but since this was international, there was no WiFi!  Truly, the only negative was the price.  It was expensive.","2016-05-01"
"5","Impressed!","First time taking Air France and I was impressed! Our plane had a second deck but my  window seat was on the first deck. I had so much room next to the window side I was able to turn sideways in my seat a sleep comfortably.  I seemed to have more legroom as well. 
The food was actually good and the flight attendant quite pleasant.","2016-04-30"
"4","Language skills of crew can be improved","Flying business class always is a pleasure anyway, in particular on long flights (13 hrs). Service was very good, but the crew didn't show an adequate level of English language skills as you might expect on international flights.","2016-04-30"

"5","very pleasent","When I flew with Air France they had re branded their short haul as Hop! For Air France. For a short haul it was very nice with lovely cabin crew who were great. When my daughter needed the toilet really badly, the captain turned off the seat belts signs just to let her go. There have been times when I've lost my bags with Air France but that didn't happen this time. There was decent food and the plane itself was a small embraer 175 and un like most short haul from Paris there was no bus just a quick step outside across a small area of tarmac and you were on board. Charles de gaulle is also much more laid back than london heathrow so you can arrive at the plane in an area with not many people in it.","2016-04-29"
"4","US to Europe on new Airbus","So, this was a trip with a big group. We had no way of knowing ahead of time what seats we had been assigned. But, we all knew each other and since I was assigned an aisle but kind of prefer a window for a long flight, I was able to trade with a friend who really, really needed the aisle due to his height.

Being a big group, we were literally at the very, very back of both upper and lower decks of the newer Airbus. Its kind of funny when you walk onto the aircraft. At first you're super impressed with the seats, the look SO comfortable! But as you walk.....and walk..... and walk......toward your seat way, way back in economy, the seats become smaller and smaller and the legroom obviously less and less.  While I have been in worse situations, I've also had better on long flights. The seats just are not very comfortable on this aircraft in economy. Thinking back, it reminds me a bit of a cardboard seat. And thats probably not far from the truth.

The good things though, were things like the entertainment system, the free wine with the good food, USB plugs to keep your phone or tablet charged and of course my friends.  It did get rather warm in the cabin, and to this day I have not figured out how to convince whoever is in charge to cool off the aircraft. Why keep it so darn hot? While it may or may not be true, it makes me feel like its breeding ground for germs, and honestly its easier to warm up if you're cold than to cool off if you're too hot.","2016-04-29"
"4","From Birmingham to the world via Paris","There in an A380, return on a 777. Not much to choose - the A380 marginally ahead as it is SO quiet. I did not have the food - prefer to sleep and both have good flat beds in Business. Last trip was in La Premiere on some promotion - honestly, not worth the additional exorbitant cost. Stick with Business. Punctual, good if cool service, no complaints.","2016-04-29"
"3","Average airline with average quality but the price was appropriate","Flight left on time, plane was well maintained and clean, the crew were nice and cordial. Entertainment system for trans-Atlantic flights is reasonable a little short on the content diversity.

"5","All in all - perfect.","It was easy to book online, the prices were reasonable and the hand luggage allowance much larger than other airlines. We were able to check-in 24 h prior to dept., choose a seat and receive our boarding passes on e-mail (which was glorious), but were also able to print our tickets at the airport if we needed it. The flight was very pleasant, the staff knowledgeable and nice. We even got a little snack! Pain au chocolat  on the morning flight and a ciabatta on the afternoon one. Free hot/cold drinks too. The flight was on time and there was SO MUCH LEGROOM. Awesome.","2016-04-25"
"3","air france","air france is a good airline, with reasonable service. legroom is fine, but with a full flight you have to stow the luggage under your chair and that is horror. the snack was reasonable, and the drinks where good. the flight was on time. boarding was a disaster.","2016-04-25"
"3","Good fligt, poor homepage!","Since I flew with my whole family to Honduras I had contact with their homepage several times. It always ended with disappointment.
For example: To fly back, I had to reconfirm the flight, but in drop down menu of the Homepage i was not even possible to choose the abbreviation of the partner airline (All flights were booked with Air France). So I wrote an email, as was recommended by the homepage. The mail finally was answered a week after I arrived at home. 
All other questions I had ended up with a call to their hotline. It always took 10 to 20 Minutes to speak with somebody. The answers I got there were imprecise and incomplete.  Example: “The contracts with the different alliance partner are all a little different. I can’t tell you if your luggage will be sent directly to the final destination or if you have to care for that yourself, because it is 5 to 8 and my shift ends at eight.”","2016-03-29"
"2","Unfriendly Check In","Check-in at CDG was a bit chaotic and there was no information anywhere about what to do.  Air France staff were quite rude.  I would not fly again with Air France if I can help it.","2016-03-29"
"5","The best airline I've flown with!","Very nice and friendly staff, a hot snack and a cold meal included (and both were excellent for plane food), free drinks, enough legroom and a good pilot- each of my four flights with Air France. Recommended!","2016-03-28"
"5","I fly Air France or KLM any time I have a chance.  My preferred airline to the States","Because of the service, food, wine, movies and general attitude of the flight
attendants, I much prefer this airline (the two combined).  The flight attendants
are efficient, have a good attitude and are not beaten down like the ones you
find on Delta and United.","2016-03-28"
"4","Good value, good comfort","My journey began in Birmingham (BHX), with an Air France partner (FlyBe). The flight from BHX to CDG (Paris) was a small airline with crappy food. I had to wait for 25 mins in the line to drop my baggage off and the flight got delayed by 40 mins. I had a layover in Paris for 1 hour 40 mins, but due to the delay in the first flight, I had to rush to board the second flight. Thus the first part of the journey was filled with incidences and details to sour the mood.
The second half, however, was delightful. My premium economy seat meant priority boarding and thus I did not have to wait in line to board. Seats were laid in a 2-4-2 configuration as compared to the economy's 3-4-3, but the width of the seat was more than enough. Legroom was really good, even for a person with one legs like me and the fixed shell of the seats meant that even if the person sitting in front of me reclined his seat, it would not affect me. The entertainment system was fairly easy to use, was fast and had good and new content. A meal (with two options) and a snack were provided in the 8 and a half hour journey, and even though it did not taste good, the overall journey was extremely comfortable. I had to cross the economy section to go to the lavatories, but that wasn't a major issue. The seat recline was a bit less for comfortable sleeping, but that was my only qualm. Priority disembarking and  baggage delivery meant I got out of the aircraft with business class passengers and got my baggage first on the carousel, which meant a speedy exit from the airport.","2016-03-28"
"2","Auwfull seats and service","This was the worst flight ever (except low cost airlines). It was a night flight to Venice.
Meal was fine, but flight attendants were only nice to French citizens; never seen anything like it. And also both my wife's and my seats were destroyed i.e. hard and bumpy. I never flew Air France after that","2016-03-28"
"4","Good Service, expensive especially if you want upgraded options","Check in was seamless. No problems and quick. Flight went to Paris first. It was great that I didnt have to collect my checked in luggage. It was sent to the connecting flight. It was a bit stressful going through security to catch the connecting flight at Paris as I couldnt understand where to go but did find out eventually. Flight from Paris to Cuba was comfortable. Screens for watching films, listening to music etc. Food was fine too. Seats were comfortable, with headrest. You were given a blanket and a pillow, eye shade and freshen up kit. I would recommend that people upgrade further from premium economy for the space alone to stretch out more for the long flight. Staff werent overly friendly. From what I could see if you were in the upper class seats the staff were very friendly. Overall a very nice flight and service but definitely a bit pricey if you want higher options in particular.","2016-03-27"
"3","Air France premium economy review","Seat: Clearly no where close to Virgin Atlantic's premium economy. The seat doesn't recline. The base of the seat slides forward to create a recline that is not very comfortable. 

Entertainment: Two of the flights had bad tv equipment, unresponsive system with bad resolution.

Travel kit was very basic.

The sky priority worked really well for checking in and boarding.

Food service was inconsistent as per description of premium economy on Air France website. Website says on long flights there is a self service buffet of sweet and savory treats, mini sandwiches and ice cream is provided. No such buffet was provided on flight from JFK to Paris or Paris to Mumbai and on return.

Website further says a selection of ice cream is provided on the flights. Ice cream was provided only on one of the 4 flights taken.

The omelette served in Breakfast between Paris to Mumbai and return was atrocious. 

While the menu said cappuccino, it was not available.

Cabin Crew: Cabin crew service was good, but no where close to Singapore Airlines'.

Overall it felt like not worth the price. While Virgin Atlantic's premium economy is closer to business class, Air France's premium economy felt more like economy.","2016-03-27"
"1","Extremly bad service and lost baggage","I did a huge mistake and booked our tickets with Air France without checking reviews online. I do have ca 250 flights every year, usually with my 2 favourite alliances. However, to Cassablanca Air France had the most convenient schedule for us.

We needed some assistance with some of the luggage since it contained some tools and computer equipment. The staff seemed extremly annoyed to assist us, especially since we didn't speak French. Not much smile and service attitude at all.

After arriving in Cassablanca, 2 of our suitcases were missing. So after waiting for one hour in the que for lost baggage, we were promised that they would send the baggage with the next plane.

The day after they could tell that they didn't send it with the expected plane. But they promised to send it as soon as possible,. The luggage arrived the day before our departure, and we had to drive to the aiport ourselves to pick it up.

This is by far the worst customer experience I have ever had with an airplane company. Bad service and bad quality. And good luck in finding some staff who wants to speak English with you. Even though we had our return tickets with Air France we didn't use them, but ordered with another company instead. No way if I am going to fly with that company ever again.

My advice: avoid them if you have alternatives !!!","2016-03-27"
"4","Pleasant flight - a little cramped","Overnight flight from Manchester to Johannesburg, changing in Paris.

The trip was on time both ways, and the steward/esses were attentive. The seating was a little cramped, however (this reviewer is 6 feet 5). Food wasn't bad by economy airline standards, and out bags made it. Can't complain for the price we paid. Would travel again.

Manchester airport, on the other hand, is a dump.","2016-03-27"
"4","Reasonable, had a good flight","Average legroom, good food and on time. Unfortunately we found the personnel to be not of the friendliest.","2016-03-26"
"5","Incredible food!","My sister and I flew Air France to and from Los Angeles to Paris.  The Premium Economy seats gave us great leg room, the food on the flight was extraordinarily good and the crew could not have been more friendly or accommodating.  Great experience!","2016-03-26"
"5","Air France","Very good service during the travel. This was a codeshare with Jet Airways.  The  food/inflight entertainment was very good. Recommended.","2016-03-26"
"4","Very good experience","Well, about 7 months before I travelled, my friend had travelled by Air France from BLR to CDG and she had ll complaints! Not minding the same, I booked in AFR from BOM to CDG in September 2015.

Believe, I had very great experience! The staff was pretty cordial and the Asian Vegetarian Meal served to us was really great! Never I expected such an awesome food by an European airline.

The travel was a little less than 9 hours and had a great sleep for over 6 hours at a stretch!","2016-03-26"
"1","Arrogant staff. Very less legroom.","One of the worst airlines I have ever traveled with. The seats are uncomfortable with very less legroom. I am an average height person and given that I had problems with legroom, I can only imagine the experience taller people must have had. To make things worse, the in-flight staff was extremely arrogant and unfriendly. I would not prefer this airline unless I absolutely have no choice.","2016-03-26"
"5","Exceptional service","The service is exceptional, the quality of the food is outstanding.  My only concern is the quality of the fleet that needs to be updated.","2016-03-26"
"5","Off on the Skies to Paris...french style !","Air France 
Flight 351 

Off on the skies to Paris...french style ! 

After a dreamed week in Ontario-Canada, our very first time there, our dear friend Michael make all arrangements for our returning from his paradisiac Country home by Lake Huron, to Pearson Toronto Airport were we had scheduled our Air France flight from there to Paris, city of lights. 
Right there, in Paris, will start our cherished and long time planned 3 Weeks Gastrotour de la France. We just had, with unparalleled success, the Ontario portion of that Gastrotour. 
At our arrival (a week before) at Pearson, we realized that it was a very nice- modernist-beautiful Airport...so, without no-surprises when we stepped into it again we fully enjoyed its architectural attractions in our way to Air France passengers Counter Services. 
We had reservations in Air France Flight 351, scheduled to depart from Toronto-Pearson-Terminal 3, to Paris at 7:47 pm (number 47 is always pursuing me since my birthday that year), arriving at Charles de Gaulle-Terminal 2E, next day at 7:33am. Which was an overnight 6 hrs 47 minutes flight in Air France's modernist Boeing 777-200 twin jet airplane. 
Eventough we knew about that Air France has those fantastic Jets we were pleasantly surprised not just about it, but all chain of their services from Counter to waiting Lounge, from waiting Lounge- the very best in Air Lines attentions and details- to boarding, from boarding to accommodating in great-comfy-seats, from there...off in the Skies to our dearest Paris. 
On Skies, either quality of services, which was impeccable and friendly, same as the flighting quality time as well; a pretty nice smooth ride on that great airplane, were seats an all its interior was carefully take care of. 
Setting and comfortability offered in that Flight were as good as it can be;
good (plenty) enough room in front, above and around seats and diverse technical gadgets. Food and beverage, typical french, were fantastic. 
Arriving on scheduled time at Charles de Gaulle beautiful-modern airport. 
There, we went trough Migration-Customs as fast as expected, BUT...

Our first hours in France-my second homeland-were terrible due to lack of professionalism and unfriendly service to costumer at Europcar Rental, Charles de Gaulle Airport, off Terminal 2E. Our joyfully mood from our flight and the thoughts of our days ahead felt from the skies-without even waring a parachute when we entered Europcar small offices there. 
Some-kind of tired from our very long road-trip from lake Huron and our overnight flight, carrying lot of baggages for our long time planned and cherished #GastrotourRoadTripFrancePortion, we founded ourselves with no-reservations, even-tough we carefully made it months ahead.  We requested their help to get perhaps another smaller car either there or at any other nearby offices, but we began to perceived a sense of ""lack of interest"" in helping us-as costumer- when I finally asks ; what about a Car in Reims or Strasbourg (our firsts stops)? and the very unkindish lady  (blase-bored of life) told us that they did not had ANY car available...anywhere ! 
That was the most ridiculous answer and the most unfriendly service that we had have ever received-in any establishment-all over the world ! 
After those miserable moments, when we found ourselves with no-car reservation, we went to next Avis rental car counter and they happily rented us a very nice BMW - SUV, that we needed for our Gastrotour-road-trip all over France 

 Once again with our great mood recovered, we were off to Alsace, our first Gastrotour stop, via Champagne. After that were lying ahead Bourgogne, Rhône, Provence ( PACA), Bordeaux-Saint Emilion...and back to Paris. 
Still fresh in our memories of that Gastrotour trip are those Great Air France Traveling in the Skies moments....moments that were happily recomfirmed in our Flight back from Paris to Santo Domingo, via Punta Cana, one month later 

For that we gratefully recognize those Air France services and without any doubt can we highly recommend to all travelers !","2016-03-25"
"5","Vive La France!!!","Have flown with AF several times, I love, that you get the offering of champagne in economy class (no british airlines offer this in economy) Meals were ok, but our first choice was not available. Really good selection of new release films and music...would definitely fly again!!!","2016-03-24"
"5","Air France-great, CDG airport what a nice surprise!","Ticketing and baggage was quick and efficient and the cabin staff were helpful and friendly. The food was good and the cabin was clean and tidy. I flew through CDG airport a few years ago and thought it to be beautiful, but very confusing and I thought I'd miss my connection. Well, what a nice surprise. I think they did new signage and added airport staff to help with finding connections. It was extremely easy to find our way with plenty of personnel for reassurance. We only had a 2 hour lay over and we were in our gate, relaxed with plenty of time to spare and enjoy the beauty of the architecture- and shops:). Congrats, CDG and Air France","2016-03-24"
"4","all was ok, price was good, service was good","all was ok, price was good, service was good, no delays, flight arrived before time, food not something, no tv","2016-03-24"
"4","Amazing","A380 - Business class, expensive,comfortable and enjoyable.  I would do it again if I had the money.  There was a slight hitch in transit but not a big problem, all sorted withing half an hour.","2016-02-21"
"1","AF CAN'T EVEN DELIVER A LUGGAGE, DON'T TALK ABOUT DELIVERING A SERVICE","We were planning a nice vacation around Europe for 2 weeks and our nice adventure starts from arriving into Paris-Amsteram-London- and back to Paris for our flight back home. 

However our first time experience with AIR FRANCE is horrible, our holiday is completely ruined by this AIRLINE-WHY?

On our flight from Paris to Amsterdam 
They left one of our luggage in Paris and that's the luggage with our medication and also clothes! 

Their incompetence together with Schipol airport has disgust me completely they ground staff at KLM simply ignore my appeal to tell them that I have medication inside the luggage and to make matters worse we have been without our luggage for more than 48 hours! 

Stranded in a foreign land in cold weather 
Without any amenities and fresh clothes to change this completely ruin our holiday from AIRFRANCE and KLM in Amsterdam! 

What was given to us was only a piece of paper ""that say please accept our most sincere apology"" blah blah blah.... 
And the staff made us wait at Schipol for the next flight for our luggage and the next and it never happen and sent us back to our hotel only to make us dream the worse nightmare came true! NO LUGGAGE ARRIVE AT ALL DESPITE WE CALL THE HOTLINE AND ALL WE GET IS PLS CALL AGAIN AND AGAIN! 

At this junction I can only tell you this AIRFRANCE - everyday you have 4-6 flight in and out via Paris and Amsterdam this is my final words to you 

YOU CANNOT EVEN DELIVER A LUGGAGE ON TIME , PLEASE DO NOT THINK ABOUT DELIVERING A GREAT CLIENT EXPERIENCE , YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR SAFETY VIDEO , BUT YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE ATTITUDE FROM YOUR STAFF AND PEOPLE WHO WORKS THERE! 

SHAME ON YOU AIR FRANCE!","2016-02-21"
"2","low cost service at high cost","as frequent flyer, I noticed that AF services get worse from flight to flight: less food, uneatable meals, minimum service by the crew, bad mantained seats with tv problems, dirty toilets after hours, no water distribution and mostly unfriendly staff","2016-02-21"
"1","Why do you work with KLM and have nothing in common","Service por,
Food you get, but for anything you need to walk and if you have a question (in English) there are three way to answer it, not, in french or like i'm better than you.
Sorry but I pay your salary, you could do better, not amused.
My parent told me if you have nothing good to say, say nothing.
Not that clean, 12 hour flight, not a good combo.","2016-02-21"
"3","Flight attendant not helpfull","i was bringing my 2 bags and baby stroller to exit form the cabin, but flight attendant standing back at me didnt help me any at all or offering some help. i was in hustle but the flight attendance was too ignorance","2016-02-21"
"5","Very comfortable friendly flights","Fantastically friendly staff, great service and on time.  The cabin crew seemed to be having more fun than the customers which was great to see.","2016-02-21"
"5","Lovely in flight service","Very easy check in, smooth take off, nice in flight service with a cup of tea and a croissant. Would definitely use air France again.","2016-02-21"
"4","Short fly","It was in time, which positively surprised me. Staff was pleasant. Food is not free of charge. Just beverages.","2016-02-20"
"4","Better than expected","Having flown Air France on my employers account a few years ago I was not expecting too much, however thanks to a major cock-up at London City where the airport (not the airline) failed to process our checked baggage I was quite impressed with Air France being able to get our baggage to us in Geneva early the following morning. Other than that I cannot really say too much.","2016-02-20"
"3","Worst airline food ever","The online check in was excellent and easy to use, having received a reminder email. We were able to change seating positions and we're able to drop off our bags without waiting in the long  Check in queue. Boarding was quick with no waiting.

However, the inflight meal was a disaster. The starter was a very tasteless, cold pasta. The main course consisted of rice, a piece of overcooked chicken that was impossible to cut with a flimsy plastic airline knife and the mixed vegetables were soft  watery and overcooked. The 2 accompanying bread rolls were so stale and rock hard that they were inedible. We brought this to the steward''s attention and he told us  that other passengers had also complained. He apologised  but said there was nothing he could do but he would report it.  The amount of uneaten food  by passengers showed the general dissatisfaction
Apart from  the catering issues the flight was good.","2016-02-20"
"2","Not the Air France I have always liked","This flight actually had a rude crew.  Maybe there was something going on behind the scenes that we will never know but it was such an aberration I'm still shocked by that flight.  Based on experience with Air France I would still recommend them for International Flights but I would not recommend for flight between Paris and Budapest.","2016-02-20"
"5","Best airline for me.","I have travelled fairly regularly for the last two years with Air France and I really don't understand the criticisms from some passengers. This one of the best if not the best airline I have flown with ever. I have been on Economy and Premium Economy on their A380 

Good : food & drinks (best by far on an airline), their A380 an excellent, more confortable plane, staff is experienced, professional, smiling and helpful. Entertainment system is great
To improve : the queues sometimes at CDG but having said that, last time it was mega quick. Flying Blue rewards should be higher perhaps.

I highly recommend this airline and I cannot wait to see the new cabin in their Boeing 777 next month when I fly back to Paris.","2016-02-19"
"3","Tight leg room.","This was roughly a 3 hour flight in Economy. Just as well it wasn't longer, as the leg room was really tight for average people.
The snack of Coffee and Macarons was tasty though.
An average flight otherwise.","2016-02-19"
"4","Good service","The flight with Air France was fine and comfortable, especially the flight from Paris to St.Maarten. They use for the flight the Airbus A340 which a modern and comfortable plane. For your entertainment are prepared new movies and some nice music. The food served on the plane was tasty, nothing to complain. 
The biggest problem was the airport Charles De Gaulle. I can describe it as a big unorganized place. Except of the size the buses are driving in a absolute chaotic manner and when you are in hurry to catch the next plane be aware to have at least 1 hour for transfer, otherwise its very tricky to catch the plane, nearly impossible.","2016-02-19"
"4","Comfortable service","This was a great flight and while I was a little challenged tapping on the screen to make the movie happen, I was surprised to be sitting in a business or premium economy seat (I do not know which) as I was just going for the cheapest ticket possible. It was a last minute kind of travel for a funeral. This was all good until my luggage was left behind in deGaulle, and I attended the funeral in travel clothes. Everyone at the Villa was at the funeral, etc. and no one was there to collect the lost luggage which they delivered to Cannes - but they kept trying and at supper time the luggage was delivered - I thought they were persistent in their attempt to rectify the situation.","2016-02-19"
"3","Air France nothing exceptional","Flight with Air France nothing exceptional. Onboard entertainment okay, staff not the friendliest. Only advantage ability to book seats with extra legroom.","2016-02-19"
"2","unpleasant surprise","Expensive ticket, a plane from Paris to Madrid was old and dirty, the staff is indifferent. Flight takes a little more than 2 hours but get only 2 small muffins and glass of water.","2016-02-18"
"3","Damaged Baggage - no assistance nor replacement nor refund","I travelled with Airfrance and had a very bad experience with my luggage which was totally smashed and unusable anymore. 
Upon arrival I declared the issue and was given the report -someone was supposed to get in contact with me which obviously did not happen. 
When I contacted Airfrance explaning that I needed a quick solution since I had another flight in a few days to catch they bluntly replyed that it was not possible. 
They simply mentioned that I could get later a refund in order to buy a new suitcase. 
Several weeks later I finally got a ridiculous offer for a refund of 150€ but which could only be used to select from their existing luggage and pay the extra which was excessively more expensive than anywehre else. 
Nither good service during the entire procedure, nor any acceptable solution... Air France is not what it used to be.","2016-02-18"
"5","AIR FRANCE HAS SPOILED ME!","Besides the astonishing new First Class cabin, Air France has by far the BEST cuisine onboard! That's the very French gastronomy heritage, #1 on this planet. Special remark: When flying First, you must take some time at La Premiere lounge/Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris - a lifetime experience!","2016-02-18"
"4","Good value for money","This was the best priced option that we cold find. Service was good and the Premium Economy class is fine for a daytime flight.","2016-02-18"
